Diseases Associated With Exposure to Contaminants in the Water Supply at Camp Lejeune,Proposed Rule,Veterans Affairs Department,"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its adjudication regulations relating to presumptive service connection to add certain diseases associated with contaminants present in the base water supply at U.S. Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (Camp Lejeune), North Carolina, from August 1, 1953 to December 31, 1987. The chemical compounds involved have been associated by various scientific organizations with the development of certain diseases. This proposed rule would establish that veterans, former reservists, and former National Guard members, who served at Camp Lejeune for no less than 30 days (consecutive or nonconsecutive) during this period, and who have been diagnosed with any of eight associated diseases, are presumed to have a service-connected disability for purposes of entitlement to VA benefits. In addition, VA proposes to establish a presumption that these individuals were disabled during the relevant period of service, thus establishing active military service for benefit purposes. Under this proposed presumption, affected former reservists and National Guard members would have veteran status for purposes of entitlement to some VA benefits. This proposed amendment would implement a decision by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that service connection on a presumptive basis is warranted for claimants who served at Camp Lejeune during the relevant period and for the requisite amount of time and later develop certain diseases. The Secretary's decision is supported by the conclusions of internationally recognized scientific authorities that strong evidence exists establishing a relationship between exposure to certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were in the water at Camp Lejeune and later development of certain disabilities.", 2016-21455,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/09/2016-21455/diseases-associated-with-exposure-to-contaminants-in-the-water-supply-at-camp-lejeune,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-09/pdf/2016-21455.pdf,09/09/2016

Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations Consistency Update for Maryland,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to update a portion of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Air Regulations. Requirements applying to OCS sources located within 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent with the requirements of the corresponding onshore area (COA), as mandated by the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (the Act). The portion of the OCS air regulations that is being updated pertains to the requirements for OCS sources for which Maryland is the designated COA. In the Rules and Regulations section of this Federal Register, EPA is taking this action as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial submittal and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this action, no further activity is contemplated. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time.", 2016-21459,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/09/2016-21459/outer-continental-shelf-air-regulations-consistency-update-for-maryland,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-09/pdf/2016-21459.pdf,09/09/2016
National Priorities List,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act''), as amended, requires that the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP'') include a list of national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants throughout the United States. The National Priorities List (``NPL'') constitutes this list. The NPL is intended primarily to guide the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'' or ``the agency'') in determining which sites warrant further investigation. These further investigations will allow the EPA to assess the nature and extent of public health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA-financed remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. This rulemaking proposes to add eight sites to the General Superfund section of the NPL.", 2016-21626,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/09/2016-21626/national-priorities-list,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-09/pdf/2016-21626.pdf,09/09/2016

This proposed AD was prompted by an occurrence that was reported of rudder pedal restriction on a SAAB Model 2000 airplane with the large potable water system (LPWS) installed, equipped with in-line heaters. This proposed AD would require installation of shrinkable tubes on the water piping of the basic potable water system (BPWS). We are proposing this AD to prevent water spray in case of a failed pipe or coupling during water filling on the ground. This condition, if not corrected, could freeze parts of the flight control system possibly resulting in reduced control of the airplane.", 2016-21165,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/08/2016-21165/airworthiness-directives-saab-ab-saab-aeronautics-formerly-known-as-saab-ab-saab-aerosystems,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-08/pdf/2016-21165.pdf,09/08/2016

Intercountry Adoptions,Proposed Rule,State Department,"The Department of State (the Department) proposes to amend requirements for accreditation of agencies and approval of persons to provide adoption services in intercountry adoption cases. The proposed rule includes a new subpart establishing parameters for U.S. accrediting entities to authorize adoption service providers who have received accreditation or approval to provide adoption services in countries designated by the Secretary, which will be known as ``country-specific authorization'' (CSA). Adoption service providers will only be permitted to act as primary providers in a CSA-designated country if they have received CSA for that particular country. The proposed rule also strengthens certain standards for accreditation and approval, including those related to fees and the use of foreign providers. In addition, the proposed rule enhances standards related to preparation of prospective adoptive parents so that they receive more training related to the most common challenges faced by adoptive families, and are better prepared for the needs of the specific child they are adopting. These proposed changes are intended to align the preparation of prospective adoptive parents with the current demographics of children immigrating to the United States through intercountry adoption. Finally, the proposed rule makes the mechanism to submit complaints about adoption service providers available to complainants even if they have not first addressed their complaint directly with the adoption service provider.", 2016-20968,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/08/2016-20968/intercountry-adoptions,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-08/pdf/2016-20968.pdf,09/08/2016

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations; Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation; Speed Limiting Devices,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,"NHTSA and FMCSA are proposing regulations that would require vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 11,793.4 kilograms (26,000 pounds) to be equipped with a speed limiting device initially set to a speed no greater than a speed to be specified in a final rule and would require motor carriers operating such vehicles in interstate commerce to maintain functional speed limiting devices set to a speed no greater than a speed to be specified in the final rule for the service life of the vehicle. Specifically, NHTSA is proposing to establish a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) requiring that each new multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, bus and school bus with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 11,793.4 kilograms (26,000 pounds) be equipped with a speed limiting device. The proposed FMVSS would also require each vehicle, as manufactured and sold, to have its device set to a speed not greater than a specified speed and to be equipped with means of reading the vehicle's current speed setting and the two previous speed settings (including the time and date the settings were changed) through its On-Board Diagnostic connection. FMCSA is proposing a complementary Federal motor carrier safety regulation (FMCSR) requiring each commercial motor vehicle (CMV) with a GVWR of more than 11,793.4 kilograms (26,000 pounds) to be equipped with a speed limiting device meeting the requirements of the proposed FMVSS applicable to the vehicle at the time of manufacture, including the requirement that the device be set to a speed not greater than a specified speed. Motor carriers operating such vehicles in interstate commerce would be required to maintain the speed limiting devices for the service life of the vehicle. Based on the agencies' review of the available data, limiting the speed of these heavy vehicles would reduce the severity of crashes involving these vehicles and reduce the resulting fatalities and injuries. We expect that, as a result of this joint rulemaking, virtually all of these vehicles would be limited to that speed.", 2016-20934,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/07/2016-20934/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards-federal-motor-carrier-safety-regulations-parts-and,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-07/pdf/2016-20934.pdf,09/07/2016

Fisheries Off West Coast States; Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery; Electronic Monitoring Program,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS proposes approval of, and regulations to implement, measures in a regulatory amendment to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The regulatory amendment was developed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) to implement an electronic monitoring (EM) program for two sectors of the limited entry trawl fishery. The regulatory amendment proposes to allow catcher vessels in the Pacific whiting fishery and fixed gear vessels in the shorebased Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) fishery to use EM in place of observers to meet the requirements of the Trawl Rationalization Program for 100-percent at-sea observer coverage. This action is intended to increase operational flexibility and reduce monitoring costs for vessels in the trawl fishery by providing an alternative to observers. Data from the EM program would be used to debit discards of IFQ species from IFQs and mothership cooperative allocations. The regulatory amendment would establish an application process for interested vessel owners, performance standards for EM systems, requirements for vessel operators, and a permitting process and standards for EM service providers. The regulatory amendment would also establish requirements for processors (first receivers) for receiving and disposing of prohibited and protected species from EM trips.", 2016-21058,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/06/2016-21058/fisheries-off-west-coast-states-pacific-coast-groundfish-fishery-electronic-monitoring-program,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-06/pdf/2016-21058.pdf,09/06/2016

"Requirements for Notification, Evaluation and Reduction of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Federally Owned Residential Property and Housing Receiving Federal Assistance; Response to Elevated Blood Lead Levels",Proposed Rule,Housing and Urban Development Department,"This proposed rule would amend HUD's lead-based paint regulations on reducing blood lead levels in children under age 6 who reside in federally-owned or -assisted pre-1978 housing and formally adopt the revised definition of ``elevated blood lead levels'' in children under the age of 6 in accordance with guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and establish more comprehensive testing and evaluation procedures for the housing where such children reside. In 2012, the CDC issued guidance revising its definition of elevated blood lead level in children under age 6 to be a blood lead level based on the distribution of blood lead levels in the national population. Since CDC's revision of its definition, HUD has applied the revised definition to funds awarded under its Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control grant program and its Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant program, and has updated its Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing to reflect this definition. CDC is continuing to consider, with respect to evolution of scientific and medical understanding, how best to identify childhood blood lead levels for which environmental interventions are recommended. Through this rule, HUD formally adopts through regulation the CDC's approach to the definition of ``elevated blood lead levels'' in children under the age of 6 and addresses the additional elements of the CDC guidance pertaining to assisted housing.", 2016-20955,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/01/2016-20955/requirements-for-notification-evaluation-and-reduction-of-lead-based-paint-hazards-in-federally,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-01/pdf/2016-20955.pdf,09/01/2016

TRICARE; Reimbursement of Long Term Care Hospitals and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities,Proposed Rule,Defense Department; Office of the Secretary,"The Department of Defense, Defense Health Agency, is proposing to revise its reimbursement of Long Term Care Hospitals (LTCHs) and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs). Proposed revisions are in accordance with the statutory provision at title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.), section 1079(i)(2) that requires TRICARE payment methods for institutional care be determined, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as apply to payments to providers of services of the same type under Medicare. Our regulation includes a definition for ``Hospital, long-term (tuberculosis, chronic care, or rehabilitation).'' This rule proposes to delete this definition and create separate definitions for ``Long Term Care Hospital'' and ``Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility'' in accordance with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) classification criteria. Under TRICARE, LTCHs and IRFs (both freestanding rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation hospital units) are currently paid the lower of a negotiated rate (if they are a network provider) or billed charges (if they are a non-network provider). Although Medicare's reimbursement methods for LTCHs and IRFs are different, it is prudent to propose adopting both the Medicare LTCH and IRF Prospective Payment System (PPS) methods simultaneously to align with our statutory requirement to utilize the same reimbursement system as Medicare. This proposed rule sets forth the proposed regulation modifications necessary for TRICARE to adopt Medicare's LTCH and IRF Prospective Payment Systems and rates applicable for inpatient services provided by LTCHs and IRFs to TRICARE beneficiaries.", 2016-20660,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/31/2016-20660/tricare-reimbursement-of-long-term-care-hospitals-and-inpatient-rehabilitation-facilities,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-08-31/pdf/2016-20660.pdf,08/31/2016

International Entrepreneur Rule,Proposed Rule,Homeland Security Department,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to amend its regulations implementing the Secretary of Homeland Security's discretionary parole authority to increase and enhance entrepreneurship, innovation, and job creation in the United States. The proposed rule would add new regulatory provisions guiding the use of parole on a case-by-case basis with respect to entrepreneurs of start-up entities whose entry into the United States would provide a significant public benefit through the substantial and demonstrated potential for rapid business growth and job creation. Such potential would be indicated by, among other things, the receipt of significant capital investment from U.S. investors with established records of successful investments, or obtaining significant awards or grants from certain Federal, State or local government entities. If granted, parole would provide a temporary initial stay of up to 2 years (which may be extended by up to an additional 3 years) to facilitate the applicant's ability to oversee and grow his or her start-up entity in the United States. A subsequent request for re-parole would be considered only when the entrepreneur and his or her start-up entity continues to provide a significant public benefit as evidenced by substantial increases in capital investment, revenue, or job creation. DHS believes that a regulatory process for seeking and granting parole in this business-creation context--including by establishing criteria for evaluating individual parole applications on a case-by-case basis--is important given the complexities involved in such adjudications and the need for guidance regarding the general criteria for eligibility by the start-up entrepreneurs, entities, and investors involved.", 2016-20663,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/31/2016-20663/international-entrepreneur-rule,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-08-31/pdf/2016-20663.pdf,08/31/2016
Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program: FEHB Employee Premium Contributions for Employees in Leave Without Pay or Other Nonpay Status,Proposed Rule,Personnel Management Office,"The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a proposed rule to provide flexibility to agencies regarding payment for Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) coverage for employees entering leave without pay (LWOP) or any other type of nonpay status, except when nonpay is as a result of a lapse of appropriations. The regulation also affects employees who have insufficient pay to cover their premium contribution. Under current regulations, a Federal agency pays the employee's share and the Government's share of FEHB premiums if an employee in LWOP or other nonpay status elects to continue coverage while in LWOP or other nonpay status and agrees to repay the agency (referred to interchangeably as ``employing office'') for their employee share upon return to employment for up to 365 days. In other words, the agency must allow an employee to incur a debt for the employee contribution to premium. This outlay of funds may result in an agency incurring a significant amount of debt. This proposed rule would provide an agency with the flexibility to require that all of its employees in LWOP or other nonpay status, except as a result of lapse of appropriations, pay their employee share for FEHB coverage directly to the agency and keep the payments current, if those employees elect to continue FEHB enrollment. Under 5 U.S.C. 8906(e), if an employee in LWOP status chooses to continue FEHB enrollment, the employee and Government contributions shall be paid on a current basis; and, if necessary, the agency shall approve advance payment of a portion of basic pay sufficient to cover the employee contribution. The agency will then recover the amount that it advanced from the employee upon his or her return to employment. Under current regulations employees in LWOP or other nonpay status can elect to make premium payments directly to an agency and keep payments current. Alternatively, employees in these circumstances may elect not to pay premiums directly on a current basis and can incur a debt such that their employing office advances the payments to cover their premiums. The employee agrees that upon his or her return to employment, or upon pay becoming sufficient, the employing office will deduct, in addition to the current pay period's premium, the accrued unpaid premiums from the employee's salary until the debt is recovered. Under this proposed rule, an agency may choose to require that an employee pay premiums directly to the agency on a current basis if the agency makes a determination that all employees in non-pay or insufficient pay status must pay premiums currently. The proposed rule also specifies the procedures for disenrollment for nonpayment of premiums.", 2016-20565,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/30/2016-20565/federal-employees-health-benefits-fehb-program-fehb-employee-premium-contributions-for-employees-in,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-08-30/pdf/2016-20565.pdf,08/30/2016

Protective Regulations for Hawaiian Spinner Dolphins Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"We, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), propose regulations under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to prohibit swimming with and approaching a Hawaiian spinner dolphin within 50 yards (45.7 m) (for persons, vessels, and objects), including approach by interception. These proposed regulatory measures are intended to prevent take of Hawaiian spinner dolphins from occurring in marine areas where viewing pressures are most prevalent; prohibitions would apply in waters within 2 nautical miles (nm; 3.7 km) of the Hawaiian Islands and in the waters between the islands of Lanai, Maui, and Kahoolawe. This proposed rule to establish 50-yard swim-with and approach regulations would help ensure public compliance by providing clear notice of prohibited conduct that results in take, including harassment and disturbance. Although unauthorized take of marine mammals, including harassment of spinner dolphins, already is and continues to be prohibited under the MMPA throughout their range, the purpose of this regulation is to identify and prohibit specific human activities that result in take (including harassment) of spinner dolphins, and thus reduce disturbance and disruption of important Hawaiian spinner dolphin behaviors in areas where human-dolphin interactions are most likely to occur. These proposed regulations would reduce take of Hawaiian spinner dolphins and the impact of human viewing and interaction on these animals in the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). We developed this proposed rule after considering comments submitted in response to an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), as well as information received during the public scoping period for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS), from community meetings, and from a dedicated scientific research project. Although not currently part of this proposal, we are also considering whether additional management measures may be necessary and appropriate to protect Hawaiian spinner dolphins from take, especially in essential daytime habitats that are regularly targeted by humans for dolphin-directed activities. Accordingly, we are soliciting public comment on the proposed swim-with and approach regulations, as well as alternative management options discussed in this rule and in detail in the DEIS.", 2016-20324,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/24/2016-20324/protective-regulations-for-hawaiian-spinner-dolphins-under-the-marine-mammal-protection-act,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-08-24/pdf/2016-20324.pdf,08/24/2016
Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedures for Central Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps,Proposed Rule,Energy Department,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposes to revise its test procedures for central air conditioners and heat pumps (CAC/HP) established under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. DOE published several proposals in a November 2015 supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNOPR). DOE finalized some of the proposed test procedure amendments in a June 2016 final rule. This SNOPR proposes additional revisions to some of the amendments proposed in the past notices and proposes some additional amendments. Specifically, this SNOPR proposes two sets of amendments to the test procedure: Amendments to appendix M that would be required as the basis for making efficiency representations starting 180 days after final rule publication; and amendments as part of a new appendix M1 that would be the basis for making efficiency representations as of the compliance date for any amended energy conservation standards. Broadly speaking, the proposed amendments address the off-mode test procedures, clarifications on test set-up and fan delays, limits to gross indoor fin surface area for valid combinations, external static pressure conditions for testing, clarifications on represented values for CAC/HP that are distributed in commerce with multiple refrigerants, and the methodology for testing and calculating heating performance. DOE does not expect the proposed changes to appendix M to change measured efficiency. However, DOE has determined that the proposed procedures in new appendix M1 would change measured efficiency. DOE welcomes comments from the public on any subject within the scope of this test procedure rulemaking.", 2016-18993,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/24/2016-18993/energy-conservation-program-test-procedures-for-central-air-conditioners-and-heat-pumps,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-08-24/pdf/2016-18993.pdf,08/24/2016

Temporary Exports to Mexico Under License Exception TMP,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; Industry and Security Bureau,"This proposed rule would align the time limit of License Exception Temporary Imports, Exports, Reexports, and Transfers (in- country) (TMP), which authorizes, among other things, certain temporary exports to Mexico, with the time limit of Mexico's Decree for the Promotion of Manufacturing, Maquiladora and Export Services (IMMEX) program. Currently, TMP allows for the temporary export and reexport of various items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), as long as the items are returned no later than one year after export, reexport, or transfer if not consumed or destroyed during the period of authorized use. Other than a four-year period for certain personal protective equipment, the one-year limit extends to all items shipped under license exception TMP. However, the one-year period does not align with the time constraints of Mexico's IMMEX program, which allows imports of items for manufacturing operations on a time limit that may exceed 18 months. This rule proposes to amend TMP to complement the timeline of the IMMEX program. Under this proposed amendment, items temporarily exported or reexported under license exception TMP and imported under the provisions of the IMMEX program would be authorized to remain in Mexico for up to four years from the date of export or reexport.", 2016-19670,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/23/2016-19670/temporary-exports-to-mexico-under-license-exception-tmp,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-08-23/pdf/2016-19670.pdf,08/23/2016

Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedures for Cooking Products,Proposed Rule,Energy Department,"On December 3, 2014, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNOPR) to revise its test procedures for cooking products. As part of the December 2014 test procedure SNOPR, DOE proposed a change to the test equipment that would allow for measuring the energy efficiency of induction cooking tops. DOE also proposed methods to test non-circular electric surface units, electric surface units with flexible concentric cooking zones, full-surface induction cooking tops, and gas burners with high input rates. In this SNOPR, to address issues raised by interested parties regarding the ability of the previous cooking top proposals to adequately measure energy use during a representative average use cycle, DOE proposes to amend its test procedure for all conventional electric cooking tops to incorporate by reference the relevant selections from European standard EN 60350-2:2013 ``Household electric cooking appliances Part 2: Hobs--Methods for measuring performance'' (EN 60350-2:2013). DOE also revises its proposals for testing non- circular electric surface units, electric surface units with flexible concentric cooking zones, and full-surface induction cooking tops based on EN 60350-2:2013. Furthermore, DOE proposes to extend the test methods in EN 60350-2:2013 to measure the energy consumption of gas cooking tops by correlating test equipment diameter to burner input rate, including input rates that exceed 14,000 British thermal units per hour (Btu/h). DOE also proposes to modify the calculations of conventional cooking top annual energy consumption and integrated annual energy consumption to account for the proposed water-heating test method. DOE proposes to incorporate by reference test structures from American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z21.1-2016 ``Household cooking gas appliances'' to standardize the installation conditions under which cooking tops are tested. DOE also proposes minor technical clarifications to the gas heating value correction and other grammatical changes to the regulatory text in appendix I that do not alter the substance of the existing test methods. With regard to conventional ovens, DOE proposes to repeal the regulatory provisions establishing the test procedure for conventional ovens under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). DOE has determined that the conventional oven test procedure may not accurately represent consumer use as it favors conventional ovens with low thermal mass and does not capture cooking performance-related benefits due to increased thermal mass of the oven cavity.", 2016-19229,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/22/2016-19229/energy-conservation-program-test-procedures-for-cooking-products,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-08-22/pdf/2016-19229.pdf,08/22/2016

Review of the General Purpose Costing System; Supplement,Proposed Rule,Surface Transportation Board,"Through this supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (Supplemental NPR), the Surface Transportation Board (Board) is revising its proposal to eliminate the ``make-whole adjustment'' that is currently applied as part of our general purpose costing system, the Uniform Railroad Costing System (URCS). The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) in this proceeding, issued on February 4, 2013, explained that when disaggregating data and calculating system-average unit costs in Phase II, URCS does not fully take into account the economies of scale realized from larger shipment sizes, necessitating an adjustment in Phase III. This subsequent adjustment in Phase III, referred to as the make-whole adjustment, produces a step function and does not appropriately reflect operating costs and economies of scale. To better address this problem and related issues, the Board is now proposing to modify certain inputs into Phase II of URCS and to modify certain cost calculations in Phase III of URCS in order to eliminate the make-whole adjustment. The Board is also proposing certain other related changes to URCS, including proposals for locomotive unit-miles (LUM) and train miles allocations, which would result in more appropriate rail movement costs.", 2016-18806,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/10/2016-18806/review-of-the-general-purpose-costing-system-supplement,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-08-10/pdf/2016-18806.pdf,08/10/2016

Since we issued AD 2012-08-11, we determined that the orientation of the retraction actuator ports must be revised to address the identified unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions required by AD 2012-08-11, and would require reorientation of the retraction actuator of the MLG, which would terminate the repetitive inspections. This proposed AD would also remove airplanes from the applicability.

Release of VA Records Relating to HIV,Proposed Rule,Veterans Affairs Department,"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its medical regulations governing the release of VA medical records. Specifically, VA proposes to eliminate the restriction on protecting a negative test result for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV testing is a common practice today in healthcare and the stigma of testing that may have been seen in the 1980s when HIV was first discovered is no longer prevalent. Continuing to protect negative HIV tests causes delays and an unnecessary burden to veterans when VA tries to share electronic medical information with the veterans' outside providers for their treatment through health information exchange efforts. For this same reason, VA would also eliminate negative test results of sickle cell anemia as protected medical information. This proposed rule would eliminate the current barriers to electronic medical information exchange.", 2016-18660,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/05/2016-18660/release-of-va-records-relating-to-hiv,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-08-05/pdf/2016-18660.pdf,08/05/2016

Thresholds for De Minimis Activity and Exemptions From Licensing Under the Animal Welfare Act,Proposed Rule,Agriculture Department; Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,"We are proposing to amend the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations in response to a 2014 Farm Bill amendment to the Act that provides the Secretary of Agriculture with the authority to determine that animal dealers and exhibitors are not required to obtain a license under the Act and regulations if the size of the business conducting AWA-related activities is determined to be de minimis by the Secretary. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has reviewed past compliance with the Animal Welfare Act of currently-regulated facilities and has determined that de minimis businesses, as defined in the rule are capable of providing adequate care and treatment of the animals involved in regulated business activities. We also propose amending the regulations in response to a 2013 amendment to the Act that excludes from the definition of ``exhibitor'' some owners of household pets that are exhibited occasionally, generate less than a substantial portion of income, and reside exclusively with the owner. Dealers and exhibitors operating at or below the thresholds determined for their particular AWA-related business activity would be exempted from Federal licensing requirements established under the Act and regulations.

Section 129H of TILA establishes special appraisal requirements for ``higher-risk mortgages,'' termed ``higher-priced mortgage loans'' or ``HPMLs'' in the agencies' regulations. The OCC, the Board, the Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) (collectively, the Agencies) issued joint final rules implementing these requirements, effective January 18, 2014. The Agencies' rules exempted, among other loan types, transactions of $25,000 or less, and required that this loan amount be adjusted annually based on any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the OCC, the Board and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year.

Data Collection for Analytics and Surveillance and Market-Based Rate Purposes,Proposed Rule,Energy Department; Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) proposes to revise its regulations to collect certain data for analytics and surveillance purposes from market-based rate (MBR) sellers and entities trading virtual products or holding financial transmission rights and to change certain aspects of the substance and format of information submitted for MBR purposes. The revisions proposed herein include new requirements for those entities to report certain information about their legal and financial connections to other entities to assist the Commission in its analytics and surveillance efforts. The Commission previously proposed to require certain market participants in the Commission-jurisdictional organized wholesale electric markets to file similar information about their financial and legal connections in the Collection of Connected Entity Data from Regional Transmission Organizations and Independent System Operators Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued in Docket No. RM15-23-000 (Connected Entity NOPR). However, as described herein, this proposal presents substantial revisions from what the Commission proposed in the Connected Entity NOPR, including, among other things: A different set of filers; a reworked and substantially narrowed definition of Connected Entity; and a different submission process. With respect to the MBR program, the proposals include: Adopting certain changes to reduce and clarify the scope of ownership information that MBR sellers must provide, similar to the notice of proposed rulemaking issued in Docket No. RM16-3-000 (Ownership NOPR); reducing the information required in asset appendices; and collecting currently-required MBR information and certain new information in a consolidated and streamlined manner. The Commission proposes all of these changes in order to eliminate duplication, ease compliance burdens, modernize its data collections, and render information collected through its programs usable and accessible for the Commission and its staff. In furtherance of this effort, in orders being issued concurrently with the instant NOPR, the Commission withdraws the Connected Entity NOPR issued in Docket No. RM15-23-000 and the Ownership NOPR issued in Docket No. RM16-3-000.\1\ The Commission also proposes to eliminate the requirement that MBR sellers submit corporate organizational charts adopted in Order No. 816 in Docket No. RM14-14-000. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------", 2016-17839,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/04/2016-17839/data-collection-for-analytics-and-surveillance-and-market-based-rate-purposes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-08-04/pdf/2016-17839.pdf,08/04/2016

This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracks on the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock pivot fittings of a CFM56 engine's thrust reverser (T/R). This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for cracking and corrosion of the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock pivot fittings of a CFM56 engine's T/R, and corrective actions if necessary.

The action would reduce discards of non- blacknose SCS while increasing the utilization of available Atlantic non-blacknose SCS quota and rebuilding and ending overfishing of Atlantic blacknose sharks. The Agency is proposing a measure that would establish a commercial retention limit of eight blacknose sharks for all Atlantic shark limited access permit holders in the Atlantic region south of 34[deg]00' N. latitude. In addition, NMFS is proposing to make two small, unrelated administrative changes to existing regulatory text to remove cross-references to an unrelated section and a section that does not exist.

Hazardous Materials: Oil Spill Response Plans and Information Sharing for High-Hazard Flammable Trains,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,"PHMSA, in consultation with the Federal Railroad Administration, is issuing this NPRM to propose revisions to regulations that would expand the applicability of comprehensive oil spill response plans (OSRPs) based on thresholds of liquid petroleum oil that apply to an entire train consist. Specifically, we are proposing to expand the applicability for comprehensive OSRPs so that any railroad that transports a single train carrying 20 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil in a continuous block or a single train carrying 35 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil throughout the train consist must also have a current comprehensive written OSRP. We are further proposing to revise the format and clarify the requirements of a comprehensive OSRP (e.g., requiring that covered railroads develop response zones describing resources available to arrive onsite to a worst-case discharge, or the substantial threat of one, which are located within 12 hours of each point along the route used by trains subject to the comprehensive OSRP). We also solicit comment on defining high volume areas and staging resources using alternative response times, including shorter response times for spills that could affect such high volume areas. Further, in accordance with the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act of 2015, this action proposes to require railroads to share information about high-hazard flammable train operations with state and tribal emergency response commissions to improve community preparedness and seeks comments on these proposals. Lastly, PHMSA is proposing to incorporate by reference an initial boiling point test for flammable liquids from the ASTM D7900 method referenced in the American National Standards Institute/American Petroleum Institute Recommend Practices 3000, ``Classifying and Loading of Crude Oil into Rail Tank Cars,'' First Edition, September 2014 as an acceptable testing alternative to the boiling point tests currently specified in the HMR. PHMSA believes providing this additional boiling test option provides regulatory flexibility and promotes enhanced safety in transport through accurate packing group assignment.", 2016-16938,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/29/2016-16938/hazardous-materials-oil-spill-response-plans-and-information-sharing-for-high-hazard-flammable,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-29/pdf/2016-16938.pdf,07/29/2016

This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that the protective polyurethane tapes applied to the upper surfaces of the aluminum and titanium floor structural members may not be trimmed properly, and on some places may overhang the profiles of the floor structural parts. Subsequent tests revealed that the overhanging pieces of tapes that are not bonded to the structure do not meet the flammability requirements and may allow fire propagation below the floor structure. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the polyurethane protective tapes installed on the floor structure for excess tape or incorrect tape installation, and corrective actions if necessary.

Hazardous Waste Management System; User Fees for the Electronic Hazardous Waste Manifest System and Amendments to Manifest Regulations,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) proposes its user fee methodology applicable to electronic and paper manifests submitted to the national electronic manifest system (or e- Manifest system) that is being established by EPA under the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act. After the implementation date for the e-Manifest system, certain users of the hazardous waste manifest would be required to pay a prescribed fee for each electronic and paper manifest they use and submit to the system in order for EPA to recover its costs of developing and operating the national e- Manifest system. The final rule that EPA develops in response to public comments on this action's proposed fee methodology will include the final fee methodology. In addition, EPA will include the initial fee schedule and the implementation date for the e-Manifest system in the preamble to the final rule. This action also proposes several amendments to the regulations governing the use of electronic hazardous waste manifests and the completion of manifests. These amendments propose: to change EPA's longstanding regulations regarding transporter changes to shipment routing information on the manifest during transportation, to specify a process by which receiving facilities may submit manifest data corrections to the e-Manifest system, and to modify a provision of the current electronic manifest use requirements that precludes the use of mixed electronic and paper manifests by those users desiring to make use of electronic manifests in settings where not all users are able to participate electronically. This action is expected to result in net cost savings amounting to $34 million per year when discounted at 7% and annualized over 6 years. Further information on the economic effects of this action can be found in section VII of this preamble.", 2016-15845,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/26/2016-15845/hazardous-waste-management-system-user-fees-for-the-electronic-hazardous-waste-manifest-system-and,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-26/pdf/2016-15845.pdf,07/26/2016
Horse Protection; Licensing of Designated Qualified Persons and Other Amendments,Proposed Rule,Agriculture Department; Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,"We are proposing to amend the horse protection regulations to provide that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will train and license Designated Qualified Persons (DQPs) to inspect horses at horse shows, exhibitions, sales, and auctions for compliance with the Horse Protection Act. DQPs are currently trained and licensed through programs certified by APHIS and initiated and maintained by horse industry organizations (HIOs). Under this proposal, APHIS will train and license DQPs on an individual basis. The proposed changes to the regulations would relieve HIOs of all regulatory burdens and requirements. We would also establish a process by which APHIS could revoke the license of a DQP for professional misconduct or failure to conduct inspections in accordance with the regulations. We would establish requirements to minimize conflicts of interest between DQPs and others within the horse industry that enable the practice of soring. We are also proposing several changes to the responsibilities of management of horse shows, exhibitions, sales, and auctions, as well as changes to the list of devices, equipment, substances, and practices that can cause soring or are otherwise prohibited under the Horse Protection Act and regulations. Additionally, we are proposing to amend the inspection procedures that DQPs are required to perform.

"Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc. Airplanes",Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We propose to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2013-02- 08, for all Bombardier, Inc. Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440) airplanes. AD 2013-02-08 currently requires inspecting the trunnions and upper and lower pins of the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator (HSTA), and replacement or re-identification if necessary; and revising the maintenance program to include safe life limits and inspection requirements for the HSTA. Since we issued AD 2013-02-08, we determined that not all affected attachment pins and trunnions were included in the required inspections. In addition, for certain airplanes on which the replacement in AD 2013-02-08 was done, incorrect attachment hardware may have been used. This proposed AD would require measuring the diameter of certain bolts and attach holes, and, as applicable, measuring the diameter of the attach holes in the trunnions and pins, doing detailed visual inspections of the trunnions, pins, and spacers, doing corrective actions, and re-identifying trunnions and pins. This proposed AD also requires revising the maintenance or inspection program. This proposed AD also removes certain airplanes from the applicability. We are proposing this AD to prevent failure of the attachment pins and trunnions of the HSTA. This condition could result in separation of the horizontal stabilizer, and consequent loss of control of the airplane.", 2016-16733,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/15/2016-16733/airworthiness-directives-bombardier-inc-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-15/pdf/2016-16733.pdf,07/15/2016
"Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc. Airplanes",Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc. Model DHC-8-400 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination by the manufacturer that shims might not have been installed between certain longerons and longeron joint fittings. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the external surface of the fuselage skin panel for loose or working fasteners, and corrective action if necessary; a detailed visual inspection of the longeron joint fittings for the existence of shims and, if necessary, repetitive inspections of the longeron and the longeron joint fittings for any cracking, and corrective action if necessary. This proposed AD would also provide terminating action for certain repetitive inspections. We are proposing this AD to detect and correct missing shims between the longerons and longeron joint fittings. Such missing shims could result in a gapping condition and lead to stress corrosion cracking of the longeron joint fittings, and could adversely affect the structural integrity of the wing-to-fuselage attachment joints.", 2016-16732,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/15/2016-16732/airworthiness-directives-bombardier-inc-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-15/pdf/2016-16732.pdf,07/15/2016

This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that the existing instruction in a certain task in the aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) will not accomplish the intent of a certification maintenance requirement (CMR). This CMR task tests the pitch feel (PF) and rudder travel limiter actuator (RTLA) back-up modules in the flight control unit (FCU) to detect dormant failures. This proposed AD would require doing an operational test of the FCU back-up modules, and repair if necessary. We are proposing this AD to detect and correct a dormant failure of both FCU back-up modules. This condition, in combination with other failures in the FCU, may result in the inability to maintain the minimum control requirements for the PF and RTLA, which could create hazardous flight control inputs during flight.", 2016-16731,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/15/2016-16731/airworthiness-directives-bombardier-inc-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-15/pdf/2016-16731.pdf,07/15/2016

"Water Quality Standards; Establishment of Revised Numeric Criteria for Selenium for the San Francisco Bay and Delta, State of California",Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to revise the current federal Clean Water Act selenium water quality criteria applicable to the San Francisco Bay and Delta to ensure that the criteria are set at levels that protect aquatic life and aquatic- dependent wildlife, including federally listed threatened and endangered species. The San Francisco Bay and Delta ecosystem is at risk due to environmental degradation, including impacts from elevated levels of selenium, and state and federal actions are underway to restore the waterway. Scientific evidence indicates that elevated selenium levels can contribute to the decline of fish and aquatic- dependent birds. EPA promulgated the San Francisco Bay and Delta's existing selenium criteria in 1992 as part of the National Toxics Rule, using EPA's recommended aquatic life criteria values at the time. However, the latest science on selenium fate and bioaccumulation indicates that the existing criteria are not protective of aquatic life and aquatic-dependent wildlife in the San Francisco Bay and Delta. Therefore, EPA is proposing to revise the existing selenium criteria, taking into account available science, legal requirements, and EPA policies and guidance. EPA's proposal will address the Administrator's determination--described in this preamble--that EPA's previously promulgated water quality criteria are not adequate to protect the designated uses for these waters.", 2016-16266,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/15/2016-16266/water-quality-standards-establishment-of-revised-numeric-criteria-for-selenium-for-the-san-francisco,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-15/pdf/2016-16266.pdf,07/15/2016

Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 787-8 and 787-9 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that some inboard and outboard trailing edge flap rotary actuators may have been assembled with an incorrect no-back brake rotor-stator stack sequence during manufacturing. This proposed AD would require an inspection of the inboard and outboard flap trailing edge rotary actuator for any discrepant rotary actuator. For discrepant rotary actuators, this proposed AD would require replacing the rotary actuator, or determining the flight cycles on the rotary actuator and doing related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. We are proposing this AD to detect and replace rotary actuators having incorrect assembly, which could cause accelerated unit wear that will eventually reduce braking performance. This degradation could lead to loss of no- back brake function and reduced controllability of the airplane.", 2016-16323,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/12/2016-16323/airworthiness-directives-the-boeing-company,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-12/pdf/2016-16323.pdf,07/12/2016
"Airworthiness Directives; Saab AB, Saab Aeronautics (Formerly Known as Saab AB, Saab Aerosystems) Airplanes",Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We are revising an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Saab AB, Saab Aeronautics Model 340A (SAAB/SF340A) and SAAB 340B airplanes. The NPRM proposed to supersede AD 2012-24-06. AD 2012-24-06 currently requires replacing the stall warning computer (SWC) with a new SWC that provides an artificial stall warning in icing conditions, and modifying the airplane for the replacement of the SWC. The NPRM was prompted by a determination that airplanes with certain modifications were excluded from the applicability in AD 2012-24-06, and are affected by the identified unsafe condition; and the SWC required by AD 2012-24-06 contained erroneous logic. This action revises the NPRM by reducing the compliance time for replacing the SWCs. We are proposing this supplemental NPRM (SNPRM) to prevent natural stall events during operation in icing conditions, which could result in loss of control of the airplane. Since this compliance time reduction imposes an additional burden to operators, we are reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these proposed changes.", 2016-15927,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/12/2016-15927/airworthiness-directives-saab-ab-saab-aeronautics-formerly-known-as-saab-ab-saab-aerosystems,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-12/pdf/2016-15927.pdf,07/12/2016

This proposed AD is intended to complete certain mandated programs intended to support the airplane reaching its limit of validity (LOV) of the engineering data that support the established structural maintenance program. This proposed AD would require repetitive detailed, high frequency eddy current (HFEC), and ultrasonic inspections of the center section rear spar upper clevis lugs and horizontal stabilizer rear spar upper lugs, as applicable, for any cracking, and related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. For certain airplanes, this proposed AD would require replacement of the center section rear spar upper chord with a new part and a serviceable center section assembly. This proposed AD would also require repetitive HFEC and fluorescent dye penetrant inspections of the center section for cracking of the front and rear spar upper clevis lugs or horizontal stabilizer front and rear spar upper lugs, and related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. We are proposing this AD to detect and correct cracking in the rear spar upper clevis lugs of the center section, and in the rear spar upper lugs of the horizontal stabilizer which could result in the loss of structural integrity and controllability of the airplane.", 2016-16322,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/12/2016-16322/airworthiness-directives-the-boeing-company-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-12/pdf/2016-16322.pdf,07/12/2016

AD 2011-17-05 currently requires repetitive inspections in sections 13 through 18 of the fuselage between rivets of the longitudinal lap joints between frames (FR) 18 and 80 for cracking, and repair or modification if necessary. Since we issued AD 2011-17-05, we have determined that a revised inspection program is necessary. This proposed AD would include a revised repetitive inspection program of all longitudinal lap joints and repairs between frames 18 and 80 to address this widespread fatigue damage (WFD).

This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that, due to significant differences among all airspeed sources, the flight controls will revert to alternate law, the autopilot (AP) and the auto-thrust (A/THR) will automatically disconnect, and the flight director (FD) bars will be automatically removed. Then, if two airspeed sources become similar while still erroneous, the flight guidance computers will display the FD bars again, and enable the re-engagement of the AP and A/THR. In some cases, however, the AP orders may be inappropriate, such as possible abrupt pitch command.

Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain REIMS AVIATION S.A. Model F406 airplanes. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as cracks found in the horizontal stabilizer rear attach structure and the vertical fin rear spar attach structure. We are issuing this proposed AD to require actions to address the unsafe condition on these products., 2016-15862,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/07/2016-15862/airworthiness-directives-reims-aviation-sa-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-07/pdf/2016-15862.pdf,07/07/2016
Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all The Boeing Company Model 767-200, and -300 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) indicating that the frame-to-floor-beam joints and frames common to shear ties at certain locations of fuselage structure are subject to widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for cracking of the frame inner chords and webs common to the floor beam joint and at frames common to the shear ties at certain sections on the left and right fuselage sides, and corrective action if necessary. We are proposing this AD to detect and correct cracking of the frame inner chords and webs common to the floor beam joint and at frames common to the shear ties at certain sections on the left and right fuselage sides, which could result in reduced structural integrity of the airplane.", 2016-15914,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/07/2016-15914/airworthiness-directives-the-boeing-company-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-07/pdf/2016-15914.pdf,07/07/2016
Pacific Island Pelagic Fisheries; 2016 U.S. Territorial Longline Bigeye Tuna Catch Limits,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS proposes a 2016 limit of 2,000 metric tons (mt) of longline-caught bigeye tuna for each U.S. Pacific territory (American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands). NMFS would allow each territory to allocate up to 1,000 mt each year to U.S. longline fishing vessels in a specified fishing agreement that meets established criteria. As an accountability measure, NMFS would monitor, attribute, and restrict (if necessary) catches of longline-caught bigeye tuna, including catches made under a specified fishing agreement. The proposed catch limits and accountability measures would support the long-term sustainability of fishery resources of the U.S. Pacific Islands.", 2016-16013,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/07/2016-16013/pacific-island-pelagic-fisheries-2016-us-territorial-longline-bigeye-tuna-catch-limits,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-07/pdf/2016-16013.pdf,07/07/2016
Fisheries of the Exclusive Economic Zone Off Alaska; Observer Coverage Requirements for Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area Trawl Catcher Vessels,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS is proposing regulations to modify observer coverage requirements for catcher vessels participating in the trawl limited access fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). If approved, this proposed rule would allow the owner of a trawl catcher vessel to request, on an annual basis, that NMFS place the vessel in the full observer coverage category for all directed fishing for groundfish using trawl gear in the BSAI in the following calendar year. This action is necessary to relieve vessel owners who request full observer coverage of the reporting requirements and observer fee liability associated with the partial observer coverage category. In addition, this proposed rule makes minor technical corrections to observer program regulations. This proposed rule is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI FMP), and other applicable laws.", 2016-15912,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/07/2016-15912/fisheries-of-the-exclusive-economic-zone-off-alaska-observer-coverage-requirements-for-bering-sea,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-07/pdf/2016-15912.pdf,07/07/2016

Definition of Importer Security Filing Importer,Proposed Rule,Homeland Security Department; U.S. Customs and Border Protection,"The Importer Security Filing and Additional Carrier Requirements regulations were implemented in 2009 as an interim final rule to improve CBP's ability to identify high-risk shipments in order to prevent smuggling and improve cargo safety and security. These regulations require certain cargo information to be submitted to CBP via an Importer Security Filing (ISF) before the cargo is loaded on a vessel that is destined to the United States. These regulations fulfill the requirements of section 203 of the SAFE Port Act of 2006 and section 343 of the Trade Act of 2002, as amended by the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. The ISF Importer is the party that is required to file the ISF.

"Endangered and Threatened Species; Removal of the Puget Sound/Georgia Basin Distinct Population Segment of Canary Rockfish From the Federal List of Threatened and Endangered Species, and Removal of Designated Critical Habitat, and Update and Amend the Listing Descriptions for the Yelloweye Rockfish DPS and Bocaccio DPS",Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"We, NMFS, are issuing a proposed rule to remove the Puget Sound/Georgia Basin canary rockfish (Sebastes pinniger) Distinct Population Segment (DPS) from the Federal List of Threatened and Endangered Species and remove its critical habitat designation as recommended in the recent five-year review under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We propose these actions based on newly obtained genetic information that demonstrates that the Puget Sound/Georgia Basin canary rockfish population does not meet the DPS criteria and therefore does not qualify for listing under the ESA. We also propose to update and amend the listing description for the Puget Sound/Georgia Basin yelloweye rockfish (S. ruberrimus) DPS based on a geographic description to include fish within specified boundaries. Further, although the current listing description is not based on boundaries, with this proposal we are also correcting a descriptive boundary for the DPS depicted on maps to include an area in the northern Johnstone Strait and Queen Charlotte Channel in waters of Canada consistent with newly obtained genetic information on yelloweye rockfish population grouping.

Housing Choice Voucher Program-New Administrative Fee Formula,Proposed Rule,Housing and Urban Development Department,"This rule proposes a new methodology for determining the amount of funding a public housing agency (PHA) will receive for administering the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program--one that uses factors that a recently completed study demonstrates are more reflective of how much it costs to administer the HCV program. Ongoing administrative fees under the HCV program are currently calculated based on the number of vouchers under lease and a percentage of the 1993 or 1994 local fair market rent, with an annual inflation adjustment. The new administrative fee formula proposed by this rule is based on a study conducted by Abt Associates for HUD that measured the actual costs of operating high-performing and efficient HCV programs and recommended a new administrative fee formula. In this rule, HUD proposes to adopt the recommended formula with modifications based largely on comments HUD received in response to a June 26, 2015 notice that solicited comment on the study. This rule proposes an ongoing administrative fee for a PHA that would be calculated based on six variables: Program size, wage rates, benefit load, percent of households with earned income, new admissions rate, and percent of assisted households that live a significant distance from the PHA's headquarters. The PHA's fee would be calculated each year based on these cost factors and a revised inflation factor would be applied to the calculated fee. This proposed rule also provides HUD with the flexibility to provide additional fees to PHAs to address program priorities such as special voucher programs (e.g., the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program), serving homeless households, and expanding housing opportunities.", 2016-15682,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/06/2016-15682/housing-choice-voucher-program-new-administrative-fee-formula,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-06/pdf/2016-15682.pdf,07/06/2016

Registrants with less than $250 million in public float would qualify, as would registrants with zero public float if their revenues were below $100 million in the previous year.", 2016-15674,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/01/2016-15674/amendments-to-smaller-reporting-company-definition,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-01/pdf/2016-15674.pdf,07/01/2016
Submission of Food and Drug Administration Import Data in the Automated Commercial Environment,Proposed Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is proposing to establish requirements for the electronic filing of entries of FDA-regulated products in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) or any other electronic data interchange (EDI) system authorized by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP), in order for the filing to be processed by CBP and to help FDA in determining admissibility of that product. ACE is a commercial trade processing system operated by CBP that is designed to implement the International Trade Data System (ITDS), automate import and export processing, enhance border security, foster U.S. economic security through lawful international trade and policy, and to replace the Automated Commercial System (ACS). FDA is a Partner Government Agency (PGA) in the initiative to establish ITDS, the ``single window'' for the submission of import and export data to the United States Government. The proposed rule would also update certain sections of FDA regulations related to imports. This rule, as proposed, does not affect the ability of filers to continue to submit their import entries and entry summaries by paper for FDA-regulated products that are being imported or offered for import. Once finalized, this action will facilitate effective and efficient admissibility review by the Agency and protect public health by allowing FDA to focus its limited resources on those FDA-regulated products being imported or offered for import that may be associated with a greater public health risk.", 2016-15684,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07/01/2016-15684/submission-of-food-and-drug-administration-import-data-in-the-automated-commercial-environment,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-07-01/pdf/2016-15684.pdf,07/01/2016

Standardizing Phytosanitary Treatment Regulations: Approval of Cold Treatment and Irradiation Facilities; Cold Treatment Schedules; Establishment of Fumigation and Cold Treatment Compliance Agreements,Proposed Rule,Agriculture Department; Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,"We are proposing to amend the phytosanitary treatment regulations to establish generic criteria that would allow for the approval of new cold treatment facilities in the Southern and Western States of the United States. These criteria, if met, would allow us to approve new cold treatment facilities without rulemaking and facilitate the importation of fruit requiring cold treatment while continuing to provide protection against the introduction of pests of concern into the United States. We are also proposing to amend the fruit cutting and inspection requirements in the cold treatment regulations in order to expand cutting and inspection to commodities that have been treated for a wider variety of pests of concern. This action would provide for a greater degree of phytosanitary protection. We are also proposing to add requirements concerning the establishment of compliance agreements for all entities that operate fumigation facilities. Finally, we are proposing to harmonize language concerning State compliance with facility establishment and parameters for the movement of consignments from the port of entry or points of origin in the United States to the treatment facility in the irradiation treatment regulations with proposed language in the cold treatment regulations. These actions would serve to codify and make enforceable existing procedures concerning compliance agreements for these facilities.", 2016-15568,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/30/2016-15568/standardizing-phytosanitary-treatment-regulations-approval-of-cold-treatment-and-irradiation,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-30/pdf/2016-15568.pdf,06/30/2016

Safety and Effectiveness of Consumer Antiseptics; Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use; Proposed Amendment of the Tentative Final Monograph; Reopening of Administrative Record,Proposed Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing this proposed rule to amend the 1994 tentative final monograph or proposed rule (the 1994 TFM) for over-the-counter (OTC) antiseptic drug products. In this proposed rule, we are proposing to establish conditions under which OTC consumer antiseptic products intended for use without water (referred to throughout as consumer antiseptic rubs or consumer rubs) are generally recognized as safe and generally recognized as effective (GRAS/GRAE). In the 1994 TFM, certain antiseptic active ingredients were proposed as being GRAS for antiseptic rub use by consumers based on safety data evaluated by FDA as part of its ongoing review of OTC antiseptic drug products. However, in light of more recent scientific developments and changes in the use patterns of these products, we are now proposing that additional safety data are necessary to support the safety of antiseptic active ingredients for this use.

Under CSAPR, large electricity generating units in Kansas are subject to a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) requiring the units to participate in CSAPR's Federal trading program for annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>). This action would approve Kansas' adoption into its SIP of state regulations establishing state-determined allocations to replace EPA's default allocations to Kansas units of CSAPR allowances for annual NO<INF>X</INF> emissions for 2017 through 2019. EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision because it meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and EPA's regulations for approval of an abbreviated SIP revision replacing EPA's default allocations of CSAPR emission allowances with state-determined allocations. Approval of this SIP revision would not alter any provision of CSAPR's Federal trading program for annual NO<INF>X</INF> emissions as applied to Kansas units other than the allowance allocation provisions, and the FIP requiring the units to participate in the trading program (as modified by the SIP revision) would remain in place.", 2016-15039,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/29/2016-15039/approval-and-promulgation-of-air-quality-implementation-plans-state-of-kansas-cross-state-air,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-29/pdf/2016-15039.pdf,06/29/2016
Magnuson-Stevens Act Provisions; Fisheries Off West Coast States; Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery; Widow Rockfish Reallocation in the Individual Fishing Quota Fishery,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"In January 2011, NMFS implemented the trawl rationalization program, a type of catch share program, for the Pacific coast groundfish fishery's limited entry trawl fleet, which includes an individual fishing quota program for limited entry trawl participants. At the time of implementation, the widow rockfish stock was overfished and quota shares were allocated to quota share permit owners in the individual fishing quota program using an overfished species formula. Now that the widow rockfish stock has been rebuilt, NMFS proposes to reallocate quota shares to initial recipients based on a target species formula that will more closely represent the fishing history of permit owners when widow rockfish was a targeted species. Through this rule, NMFS also proposes to allow the trading of widow rockfish quota shares, set a deadline for divestiture in case the reallocation of widow rockfish puts any QS permit owner over an accumulation limit, and remove the daily vessel limit for widow rockfish since it is no longer an overfished species.", 2016-15217,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/29/2016-15217/magnuson-stevens-act-provisions-fisheries-off-west-coast-states-pacific-coast-groundfish-fishery,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-29/pdf/2016-15217.pdf,06/29/2016
Alternatives to References to Credit Ratings With Respect to Permissible Activities for Foreign Branches of Insured State Nonmember Banks and Pledge of Assets by Insured Domestic Branches of Foreign Banks,Proposed Rule,Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,"The FDIC is seeking public comment on a proposed rule to amend its international banking regulations (``Part 347'') consistent with section 939A (``section 939A'') of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'') and the FDIC's authority under section 5(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (``FDI Act''). Section 939A directs each federal agency to review and modify regulations that reference credit ratings. The proposed rule would amend the provisions of subparts A and B of Part 347 that reference credit ratings. Subpart A, which sets forth the FDIC's requirements for insured state nonmember banks that operate foreign branches, would be amended to replace references to credit ratings in the definition of ``investment grade'' with a standard of creditworthiness that has been adopted in other federal regulations that conform with section 939A. Subpart B would be amended to revise the FDIC's asset pledge requirement for insured U.S. branches of foreign banks. The eligibility criteria for the types of assets that foreign banks may pledge would be amended by replacing the references to credit ratings with the revised definition of ``investment grade.'' The proposed rule would apply this investment grade standard to each type of pledgeable asset, establish a liquidity requirement for such assets, and subject them to a fair value discount. The proposed rule would also introduce cash as a new asset type that foreign banks may pledge under subpart B and create a separate asset category expressly for debt securities issued by government sponsored enterprises.", 2016-15096,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/28/2016-15096/alternatives-to-references-to-credit-ratings-with-respect-to-permissible-activities-for-foreign,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-28/pdf/2016-15096.pdf,06/28/2016
Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We are revising an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Model A318 and A319 series airplanes, A320-211, - 212, -214, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes, and A321 series airplanes. The NPRM proposed to require an inspection to identify the part number and serial number of the main landing gear (MLG) sliding tubes installed on the airplane; and inspection of affected chromium plates for damage; an inspection of affected sliding tube axles for damage; and replacement of the sliding tube if necessary. The NPRM was prompted by a report of a rupture of a MLG sliding tube axle. This action revises the NPRM by removing certain service information that does not adequately address the identified unsafe condition and revising the compliance method. We are proposing this supplemental NPRM (SNPRM) to detect and correct cracks in the axle and (partial) detachment of the axle and wheel from the sliding tube, which could result in failure of an MLG. Since these actions impose an additional burden over those proposed in the NPRM, we are reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these proposed changes.", 2016-14969,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/28/2016-14969/airworthiness-directives-airbus-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-28/pdf/2016-14969.pdf,06/28/2016

This proposed AD was prompted by a report that a potential chafing condition exists between the negative-G fuel feed drain line of the auxiliary power unit (APU) and its surrounding structure and components. This proposed AD would require, for certain airplanes, a detailed inspection for chafing conditions of the negative-G fuel feed drain line of the APU, and corrective actions if necessary. For certain other airplanes, this proposed AD would require replacement of the APU negative-G fuel feed tube assembly and the drain line. We are proposing this AD to prevent a chafing condition in the negative-G fuel feed drain line, which can result in fuel leaking from the drain line. Leakage of the negative-G fuel feed drain line is a dormant failure. This condition, in combination with a nearby hot surface or other potential ignition source, could result in an uncontrolled fire in the aft equipment bay.", 2016-14965,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/28/2016-14965/airworthiness-directives-bombardier-inc-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-28/pdf/2016-14965.pdf,06/28/2016

This proposed AD was prompted by a report indicating that during inspections to detect corrosion of the bulk cargo doors, several cracks were discovered. This proposed AD would require a general visual inspection of the bulk cargo door frame to identify any structural repairs, a detailed visual inspection of the frame at the repaired area for any cracking if necessary, and corrective actions if necessary. We are proposing this AD to detect and correct cracking of the bulk cargo doors; such cracking could result in rapid airplane decompression or possible loss of the bulk cargo door.", 2016-14968,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/28/2016-14968/airworthiness-directives-airbus-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-28/pdf/2016-14968.pdf,06/28/2016
Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-700 and -700C series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that for airplanes with blended winglets, the nose-up pitch trim limit and associated warning for the horizontal stabilizer control system will allow take-off with incorrect trim settings. This proposed AD would require, depending on airplane configuration, replacing the pitch trim light plates on the flight deck control stand, relocating the position warning horn switches of the horizontal stabilizer, revising the software, removing the placard, and doing related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. We are proposing this AD to prevent take-off with incorrect settings of the horizontal stabilizer pitch trim system.

Model DHC-8-102, -103, and -106 airplanes, Model DHC-8-200 series airplanes, and Model DHC-8-300 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by several occurrences of loss of airspeed data on both pilot and co-pilot air speed indicators due to the accumulation of ice on the pitot probes. An investigation revealed that the accumulation of ice was due to inoperative pitot probe heaters. This proposed AD would require replacing the existing circuit breakers in both the left and right side of the pitot heater system with circuit breakers that have higher trip points. We are proposing this AD to prevent circuit breakers from tripping and cutting power supply to the pitot probe heater, which could cause loss of airspeed data and result in the flightcrew not being able to control the airspeed of the airplane.", 2016-14971,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/28/2016-14971/airworthiness-directives-bombardier-inc-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-28/pdf/2016-14971.pdf,06/28/2016

Air Plan Approval; Alabama; Cross-State Air Pollution Rule,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve portions of the October 26, 2015, State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal from Alabama concerning the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). Under CSAPR, large electricity generating units (EGUs) in Alabama are subject to Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) requiring the units to participate in CSAPR's federal trading program for annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and one of CSAPR's two federal trading programs for annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>). This action would approve into Alabama's SIP the state's regulations requiring Alabama EGUs to participate in new CSAPR state trading programs for annual NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> emissions integrated with the CSAPR federal trading programs, replacing the corresponding FIP requirements. These CSAPR state trading programs are substantively identical to the CSAPR federal trading programs except with regard to the provisions allocating emission allowances among Alabama units. EPA is proposing to approve the portions of the SIP revision concerning these CSAPR state trading programs because these portions of the SIP revision meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) and EPA's regulations for approval of a CSAPR full SIP revision replacing the requirements of a CSAPR FIP. Under the CSAPR regulations, approval of these portions of the SIP revision would automatically eliminate Alabama units' obligations to participate in CSAPR's federal trading programs for annual NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> emissions under the corresponding CSAPR FIPs addressing interstate transport requirements for the 1997 and 2006 Fine Particulate Matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). Approval of these portions of the SIP revision would satisfy Alabama's good neighbor obligation under the CAA to prohibit emissions which will significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 1997 and 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS in any other state. EPA is not proposing to act at this time on the portion of Alabama's SIP submittal intended to replace Alabama units' obligations to participate in CSAPR's federal trading program for ozone-season NO<INF>X</INF> emissions under a separate CSAPR FIP.", 2016-15146,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/28/2016-15146/air-plan-approval-alabama-cross-state-air-pollution-rule,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-28/pdf/2016-15146.pdf,06/28/2016
Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; State of Missouri; Cross-State Air Pollution Rule,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve portions of a November 20, 2015, State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal from Missouri concerning allocations of Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) emission allowances. Under CSAPR, large electricity generating units in Missouri are subject to Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) requiring the units to participate in CSAPR's Federal trading program for annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and one of CSAPR's two Federal trading programs for annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>). This action would approve Missouri's adoption into its SIP of state regulations establishing state-determined allocations to replace EPA's default allocations to Missouri units of CSAPR allowances for annual NO<INF>X</INF> emissions and annual SO<INF>2</INF> emissions for 2017 and later years. EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision because it meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and EPA's regulations for approval of an abbreviated SIP revision replacing EPA's default allocations of CSAPR emission allowances with state-determined allocations. Approval of this SIP revision would not alter any provision of CSAPR's Federal trading programs for annual NO<INF>X</INF> emissions and annual SO<INF>2</INF> emissions as applied to Missouri units other than the allowance allocation provisions, and the FIPs requiring the units to participate in those trading programs (as modified by the SIP revision) would remain in place.

Metropolitan Planning Organization Coordination and Planning Area Reform,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Highway Administration; Federal Transit Administration,"The FHWA and FTA propose revisions to the transportation planning regulations to promote more effective regional planning by States and metropolitan planning organizations (MPO). The goal of the proposed revisions is to result in unified planning products for each urbanized area (UZA), even if there are multiple MPOs designated within that urbanized area. Specifically it would result in MPOs developing a single metropolitan transportation plan, a single transportation improvement program (TIP), and a jointly established set of performance targets for the entire urbanized area and contiguous area expected to become urbanized within a 20-year forecast period for the transportation plan. If multiple MPOs are designated within that urbanized area, they would jointly prepare these unified planning products. To accomplish this, the proposed revisions clarify that the metropolitan planning area must include the entire urbanized area and contiguous area expected to become urbanized within 20 years. These proposed revisions would better align the planning regulations with statutory provisions concerning the establishment of metropolitan planning area (MPA) boundaries and the designation of MPOs. This includes the statutory requirement for the MPA to include an urbanized area in its entirety, and the exception provision to allow more than one MPO to serve a single MPA if warranted by the size and complexity of the MPA. The rulemaking would establish clearer operating procedures, and reinstate certain coordination and decisionmaking requirements for situations where there is more than one MPO serving an MPA. The proposed rule includes a requirement for unified planning products for the MPA including jointly established performance targets within an MPA, and a single metropolitan transportation plan and TIP for the entire MPA in order to result in planning products that reflect the regional needs of the entire urbanized area. These unified planning products would be jointly developed by the multiple MPOs in such MPAs where more than one MPO is designated.

Revisions to Public Inspection File Requirements-Broadcaster Correspondence File and Cable Principal Headend Location,Proposed Rule,Federal Communications Commission,"In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) proposes to eliminate two public inspection file requirements--the requirement that commercial broadcast stations retain in their public inspection file copies of letters and emails from the public and the requirement that cable operators maintain for public inspection the designation and location of the cable system's principal headend. Because of potential privacy concerns associated with putting the correspondence file online and because many cable operators prefer not to post online the location of their principal headend for security reasons, removing these requirements would enable commercial broadcasters and cable operators to make their entire public inspection file available online and obviate also maintaining a local public file. Eliminating these public file requirements thus would reduce the regulatory burdens on commercial broadcasters and cable operators.", 2016-14793,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/22/2016-14793/revisions-to-public-inspection-file-requirements-broadcaster-correspondence-file-and-cable-principal,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-22/pdf/2016-14793.pdf,06/22/2016

This proposed AD was prompted by a quality control review on the final assembly line, which determined that the wrong aluminum alloy was used to manufacture several structural parts. This proposed AD would require a one-time eddy current conductivity measurement of certain cabin and cargo compartment structural parts to determine if an incorrect aluminum alloy was used, and replacement of any affected part with a serviceable part. We are proposing this AD to detect and replace structural parts made of incorrect aluminum alloy.

AD 98-13- 14 also provides for an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. Since we issued AD 98-13-14, an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) indicates that the former junction of the aft fuselage is subject to fatigue damage. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 98-13-14, with revised inspection compliance times.

The NPRM proposed to require modification of the anti-collision light bonding. The NPRM was prompted by a report of an in-flight lightning strike to the WHELEN anti-collision light located on the top of the vertical fin tip that caused severe damage and resulted in the loss of some airplane functions. This action revises the NPRM by clarifying the applicability. We are proposing this supplemental NPRM (SNPRM) to prevent loss of electrical power and essential airplane functions, and possible reduced control of the airplane.

Establishing a More Effective Fair Market Rent System; Using Small Area Fair Market Rents in Housing Choice Voucher Program Instead of the Current 50th Percentile FMRs,Proposed Rule,Housing and Urban Development Department,"This rulemaking proposes the use of Small Area Fair Market Rents (Small Area FMRs) in the administration of the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program for certain metropolitan areas. HUD is proposing to use Small Area FMRs in place of the current 50th percentile rent to address high levels of voucher concentration. HUD believes that Small Area FMRs gives HCV tenants a more effective means to move into areas of higher opportunity and lower poverty areas by providing them with subsidy adequate to make such areas accessible and to thereby reduce the number of voucher families that reside in areas of high poverty concentration. HUD proposes to use several criteria for determining which metropolitan areas would best be served by application of Small Area FMRs in the administration of the HCV program. These criteria include a threshold number of vouchers within a metropolitan area, the concentration of current HCV tenants in low-income areas, and the percentage of renter occupied units within the metropolitan area with gross rents above the payment standard basic range. Public housing agencies (PHAs) operating in designated metropolitan areas would be required to use Small Area FMRs. PHAs not operating in the designated areas would have the option to use Small Area FMRs in administering their HCV programs. Other programs that use FMRs would continue to use area-wide FMRs. HUD's goal in pursuing this rulemaking is to provide HCV tenants with a greater ability to move into areas where jobs, transportation, and educational opportunities exist.", 2016-13939,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/16/2016-13939/establishing-a-more-effective-fair-market-rent-system-using-small-area-fair-market-rents-in-housing,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-16/pdf/2016-13939.pdf,06/16/2016

Removal of Title V Emergency Affirmative Defense Provisions From State Operating Permit Programs and Federal Operating Permit Program,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to remove the affirmative defense provisions for emergencies found in the regulations for state and federal operating permit programs. These provisions establish an affirmative defense that sources can assert in civil enforcement cases when noncompliance with certain emission limitations in operating permits occurs because of qualifying ``emergency'' circumstances. These provisions, which have never been required elements of state operating permit programs, are being removed because they are inconsistent with the enforcement structure of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and recent court decisions from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

Position Limits for Derivatives: Certain Exemptions and Guidance,Proposed Rule,Commodity Futures Trading Commission,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is proposing revisions and additions to regulations and guidance proposed in 2013 concerning speculative position limits in response to comments received on that proposal. The Commission is proposing new alternative processes for designated contract markets (``DCMs'') and swap execution facilities (``SEFs'') to recognize certain positions in commodity derivative contracts as non-enumerated bona fide hedges or enumerated anticipatory bona fide hedges, as well as to exempt from federal position limits certain spread positions, in each case subject to Commission review.

Introduction to the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions,Proposed Rule,Regulatory Information Service Center,"The Spring 2016 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. Publication of the Spring 2016 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions represents a key component of the regulatory planning mechanism prescribed in Executive Order 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735) and incorporated by reference in the President's Executive Order 13563, ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,'' issued on January 18, 2011 (76 FR 3821). The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies publish semiannual regulatory agendas in the Federal Register describing regulatory actions they are developing that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (5 U.S.C. 602). In the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda) agencies report regulatory actions upcoming in the next year. Executive Order 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' signed September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51735), and Office of Management and Budget memoranda implementing section 4 of that Order establish minimum standards for agencies' agendas, including specific types of information for each entry. The Unified Agenda helps agencies fulfill these requirements. All Federal regulatory agencies have chosen to publish their regulatory agendas as part of the Unified Agenda. The complete Unified Agenda for spring 2016, which contains the regulatory agendas for 57 Federal agencies, is available to the public at http://reginfo.gov. The spring 2016 Unified Agenda publication appearing in the Federal Register consists of agency regulatory flexibility agendas, in accordance with the publication requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Agency regulatory flexibility agendas contain only those Agenda entries for rules that are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and entries that have been selected for periodic review under section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.", 2016-12869,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/09/2016-12869/introduction-to-the-unified-agenda-of-federal-regulatory-and-deregulatory-actions,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-09/pdf/2016-12869.pdf,06/09/2016

The agenda also describes regulations affecting small entities as required by section 602 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Public Law 96-354. This agenda also identifies regulatory actions that are being reviewed in compliance with section 610(c) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. We invite public comment on those actions as well as any regulation consistent with Executive Order 13563. USDA has attempted to list all regulations and regulatory reviews pending at the time of publication except for minor and routine or repetitive actions, but some may have been inadvertently missed. There is no legal significance to the omission of an item from this listing. Also, the dates shown for the steps of each action are estimated and are not commitments to act on or by the date shown. USDA's complete regulatory agenda is available online at www.reginfo.gov.

It contains DoD regulations initiated by DoD components that may have economic and environmental impact on State, local, or tribal interests under the criteria of Executive Order 12866. Although most DoD regulations listed in the agenda are of limited public impact, their nature may be of public interest and, therefore, are published to provide notice of rulemaking and an opportunity for public participation in the internal DoD rulemaking process. Members of the public may submit comments on individual proposed and interim final rulemakings at www.regulations.gov during the comment period that follows publication in the Federal Register. This agenda updates the report published on November 19, 2015, and includes regulations expected to be issued and under review over the next 12 months. The next agenda is scheduled to be published in the fall of 2016. The complete Unified Agenda will be available online at www.reginfo.gov.

To comply with the order, the Federal Subsistence Board (Board) must initiate a regulatory proceeding to identify those submerged lands within the Tongass National Forest that did not pass to the State of Alaska at statehood and, therefore, remain Federal public lands subject to the subsistence provisions of ANILCA. Following the Court's decision, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA-Forest Service (USDA-FS) started a review of hundreds of potential pre-statehood (January 3, 1959) withdrawals in the marine waters of the Tongass National Forest. In April and October of 2015, BLM submitted initial lists of submerged public lands to the Board.

Addition of Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) Category; Community Right-to-Know Toxic Chemical Release Reporting,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"EPA is proposing to add a hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) category to the list of toxic chemicals subject to reporting under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA). EPA is proposing to add this chemical category to the EPCRA section 313 list because EPA believes HBCD meets the EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) and (C) toxicity criteria. Specifically, EPA believes that HBCD can reasonably be anticipated to cause developmental and reproductive effects in humans and is highly toxic to aquatic and terrestrial organisms. In addition, based on the available bioaccumulation and persistence data, EPA believes that HBCD should be classified as a persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) chemical and assigned a 100-pound reporting threshold. Based on a review of the available production and use information, members of the HBCD category are expected to be manufactured, processed, or otherwise used in quantities that would exceed a 100-pound EPCRA section 313 reporting threshold.", 2016-12464,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/02/2016-12464/addition-of-hexabromocyclododecane-hbcd-category-community-right-to-know-toxic-chemical-release,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-02/pdf/2016-12464.pdf,06/02/2016

This proposed AD would require repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections of the aft LDCD frame forks; a one-time check of the LDCD clearances; and a one- time detailed visual inspection of hooks, eccentric bushes, and x- stops; and corrective actions if necessary. We are proposing this AD to detect and correct cracked or ruptured aft LDCD frames, which could allow loads to be transferred to the remaining structural elements. This condition could lead to the rupture of one or more vertical aft LDCD frames, which could result in reduced structural integrity of the aft LDCD.", 2016-12522,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/31/2016-12522/airworthiness-directives-airbus-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-31/pdf/2016-12522.pdf,05/31/2016

This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a production quality deficiency on the inner retainer installed on link assemblies of the engine mount, which could result in failure of the retainer. This proposed AD would require an inspection for, and replacement of, all non-conforming aft engine mount retainers. We are proposing this AD to detect and correct non- conforming retainers of the aft engine mount. This condition could result in the loss of the locking feature of the nuts of the inner and outer pins; loss of the pins will result in the aft mount engine link no longer being secured to the aft engine mount, possibly resulting in damage to the airplane and injury to persons on the ground.", 2016-12593,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/31/2016-12593/airworthiness-directives-airbus-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-31/pdf/2016-12593.pdf,05/31/2016

Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Commercial Water Heating Equipment,Proposed Rule,Energy Department,"The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as amended, prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including commercial water heaters, hot water supply boilers, and unfired hot water storage tanks (hereinafter referred to as ``commercial water heating (CWH) equipment''). EPCA also requires that every 6 years, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) must determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would save a significant amount of energy. In this action, DOE has tentatively concluded that there is clear and convincing evidence to support more-stringent standards for several classes of the equipment that are the subject of this rulemaking. DOE did not consider more-stringent standards in this action for commercial oil-fired storage water heaters, whose standards were recently amended. Therefore, DOE proposes amended energy conservation standards for certain commercial water heating equipment, and also announces a public meeting to receive comment on these proposed standards and associated analyses and results.", 2016-12178,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/31/2016-12178/energy-conservation-program-energy-conservation-standards-for-commercial-water-heating-equipment,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-31/pdf/2016-12178.pdf,05/31/2016

Renewable Fuel Standard Program: Standards for 2017 and Biomass-Based Diesel Volume for 2018,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"Under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to set renewable fuel percentage standards every year. This action proposes the annual percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that would apply to all motor vehicle gasoline and diesel produced or imported in the year 2017. The EPA is proposing a cellulosic biofuel volume that is below the applicable volume specified in the Act. Relying on statutory waiver authorities, the EPA is also proposing to reduce the applicable volumes of advanced biofuel and total renewable fuel. The proposed standards are expected to continue driving the market to overcome constraints in renewable fuel distribution infrastructure, which in turn is expected to lead to substantial growth over time in the production and use of renewable fuels. In this action, we are also proposing the applicable volume of biomass-based diesel for 2018.", 2016-12369,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/31/2016-12369/renewable-fuel-standard-program-standards-for-2017-and-biomass-based-diesel-volume-for-2018,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-31/pdf/2016-12369.pdf,05/31/2016

This proposed AD would require a visual inspection of the main rotor blade (MRB) and either removing or altering it. This proposed AD is prompted by a report that a fatigue crack was found at an MRB's trailing edge and a determination that some MRBs may have reduced blade thickness due to blending out corrosion. The proposed actions are intended to prevent an MRB fatigue crack, which could lead to MRB failure and subsequent loss of helicopter control.", 2016-12442,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/27/2016-12442/airworthiness-directives-robinson-helicopter-company-helicopters,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-12442.pdf,05/27/2016
Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We are revising an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 767-300 and 767-300F series airplanes. The NPRM proposed to require modification and installation of components in the main equipment center. For certain other airplanes, the NPRM proposed to require modification, replacement, and installation of flight deck air relief system (FDARS) components. The NPRM was prompted by reports of malfunctions in the flight deck display units, which resulted in blanking, blurring, or loss of color on the display. This action revises the NPRM by revising the applicability; adding certain modifications; and clarifying certain requirements. We are proposing this supplemental NPRM (SNPRM) to prevent malfunctions of the flight deck display units, which could affect the ability of the flightcrew to read the displays for airplane attitude, altitude, or airspeed, and consequently reduce the ability of the flightcrew to maintain control of the airplane.

Fisheries Off West Coast States; Coastal Pelagic Species Fisheries; Annual Specifications,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS proposes to implement annual management measures and harvest specifications to establish the allowable catch levels (i.e. annual catch limit (ACL)/harvest guideline (HG)) for the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (hereafter, simply Pacific sardine), in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off the Pacific coast for the fishing season of July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. This rule is proposed according to the Coastal Pelagic Species (CPS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The proposed action would prohibit directed non- tribal Pacific sardine commercial fishing for Pacific sardine off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California, which is required because the estimated 2016 biomass of Pacific sardine has dropped below the biomass threshold specified in the HG control rule. Under the proposed action, Pacific sardine may still be harvested as part of either the live bait or tribal fishery or as incidental catch in other fisheries; the incidental harvest of Pacific sardine would initially be limited to 40-percent by weight of all fish per trip when caught with other CPS or up to 2 metric tons (mt) when caught with non-CPS. The proposed annual catch limit (ACL) for the 2016-2017 Pacific sardine fishing year is 8,000 mt.

Designation of Agent To Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement,Proposed Rule,"Library of Congress; Copyright Office, Library of Congress","Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (``DMCA''), the U.S. Copyright Office is required to maintain a current directory of agents that have been designated by online service providers to receive notifications of claimed infringement. Since the DMCA's enactment in 1998, online service providers have used a paper form to designate agents with the Copyright Office, and the Office has made scanned copies of those paper forms available to the public by posting them on the Office's Web site. In 2011, the Copyright Office issued a notice proposing updated regulations governing the designation of agents under the DMCA in anticipation of the creation of a new online system though which service providers could more efficiently designate agents with the Copyright Office and the public could more easily search for such agents. With the development of this electronic system approaching completion, this notice proposes an amendment of the Office's regulations to lower the fee for designating an agent under the DMCA.", 2016-12227,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/25/2016-12227/designation-of-agent-to-receive-notification-of-claimed-infringement,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-25/pdf/2016-12227.pdf,05/25/2016
Advanced Practice Registered Nurses,Proposed Rule,Veterans Affairs Department,"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its medical regulations to permit full practice authority of all VA advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) when they are acting within the scope of their VA employment. This rulemaking would increase veterans' access to VA health care by expanding the pool of qualified health care professionals who are authorized to provide primary health care and other related health care services to the full extent of their education, training, and certification, without the clinical supervision of physicians. This rule would permit VA to use its health care resources more effectively and in a manner that is consistent with the role of APRNs in the non-VA health care sector, while maintaining the patient-centered, safe, high-quality health care that veterans receive from VA. The proposed rulemaking would establish additional professional qualifications an individual must possess to be appointed as an APRN within VA. The proposed rulemaking would subdivide APRN's into four separate categories that include certified nurse practitioner, certified registered nurse anesthetist, clinical nurse specialist, and certified nurse-midwife. The proposed rulemaking would also provide the criteria under which VA may grant full practice authority to an APRN, and define the scope of full practice authority for each category of APRN. VA intends that the services to be provided by an APRN in one of the four APRN roles would be consistent with the nursing profession's standards of practice for such roles.", 2016-12338,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/25/2016-12338/advanced-practice-registered-nurses,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-25/pdf/2016-12338.pdf,05/25/2016

"Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Recreational Management Measures for the Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass Fisheries; Fishing Year 2016",Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS proposes management measures for the 2016 summer flounder, scup, and black sea bass recreational fisheries. NMFS is also proposing a change to the commercial scup incidental possession limit, and two minor corrections to the summer flounder minimum mesh size regulations. The implementing regulations for these fisheries require NMFS to publish recreational measures for the fishing year and to provide an opportunity for public comment.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Strengthening the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program,Proposed Rule,Housing and Urban Development Department,"This rule proposes to codify several significant changes to FHA's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program that were previously issued under the authority granted to HUD in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and the Reverse Mortgage Stabilization Act of 2013, and to make additional regulatory changes. The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program is FHA's reverse mortgage program that enables seniors who have equity in their homes to withdraw a portion of the accumulated equity. The intent of the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program is to ease the financial burden on elderly homeowners facing increased health, housing, and subsistence costs at a time of reduced income. FHA's mission is to serve underserved markets, which must be balanced with HUD's inherent, as well as, statutory obligation under the National Housing Act to protect the FHA insurance funds. The impacts of the recent financial crisis, including a decline in property values, shrinking retirement accounts, and changing borrower demographics placed seniors with Home Equity Conversion Mortgages at an increased risk of losing their homes due to their inability to make tax and insurance payments. During this time, the FHA HECM program was the only reverse mortgage program available for seniors. The above referenced economic and market factors, combined with certain program features, resulted in increased risk to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF). This rulemaking strengthens the FHA HECM program and codifies changes made under the Reverse Mortgage Stabilization Act of 2013 that reduce risk to the MMIF and increase the sustainability of this important program for seniors.", 2016-11631,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/19/2016-11631/federal-housing-administration-fha-strengthening-the-home-equity-conversion-mortgage-program,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-19/pdf/2016-11631.pdf,05/19/2016
Narrowing the Digital Divide Through Installation of Broadband Infrastructure in HUD-Funded New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation of Multifamily Rental Housing,Proposed Rule,Housing and Urban Development Department,"Through this proposed rule, HUD continues its efforts to narrow the digital divide in low-income communities served by HUD by providing, where feasible and with HUD funding, broadband infrastructure to communities in need of such infrastructure. Broadband is the common term used to refer to a very fast connection to the Internet. Such connection is also referred to as high-speed broadband, broadband Internet, or high-speed Internet. In this proposed rule, HUD proposes to require installation of broadband infrastructure at the time of new construction or substantial rehabilitation of multifamily rental housing that is funded or supported by HUD. Installation of broadband infrastructure at the time of new construction or substantial rehabilitation is generally easier and less costly than when such installation is undertaken as a stand-alone effort. The proposed rule, however, recognizes that installation of broadband infrastructure may not be feasible for all new construction or substantial rehabilitation, and, therefore, the proposed rule allows limited exceptions to the installation requirements. Installing unit-based broadband infrastructure in multifamily rental housing that is newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated with or supported by HUD funding will provide a platform for individuals and families residing in such housing to participate in the digital economy, and increase their access to economic opportunities.", 2016-11352,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/18/2016-11352/narrowing-the-digital-divide-through-installation-of-broadband-infrastructure-in-hud-funded-new,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-18/pdf/2016-11352.pdf,05/18/2016
Modernizing HUD's Consolidated Planning Process To Narrow the Digital Divide and Increase Resilience to Natural Hazards,Proposed Rule,Housing and Urban Development Department,"HUD's Consolidated Plan is a planning mechanism designed to help States and local governments to assess their affordable housing and community development needs and to make data-driven, place-based investment decisions. The consolidated planning process serves as the framework for a community-wide dialogue to identify housing and community development priorities that align and focus funding from HUD's formula block grant programs. This proposed rule would amend HUD's Consolidated Plan regulations to require that jurisdictions consider two additional concepts in their planning efforts. The first concept is how to address the need for broadband access for low- and moderate-income residents in the communities they serve. Broadband is the common term used to refer to a high-speed, always on connection to the Internet. Such connection is also referred to as high-speed broadband or high-speed Internet. Specifically, the proposed rule would require that States and localities that submit a consolidated plan describe the broadband access in housing occupied by low- and moderate-income households.

National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES): Applications and Program Updates,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes revisions to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System regulations to eliminate regulatory and application form inconsistencies; improve permit documentation, transparency and oversight; clarify existing regulations; and remove outdated provisions. This proposal would make specific targeted changes to the existing regulations and would not reopen the regulations for other specific or comprehensive revision. These proposed regulatory changes cover 15 topics in the following major categories: permit applications; the water quality-based permitting process; permit objection, documentation and process efficiencies; the vessels exclusion; and the Clean Water Act (CWA) section 401 certification process. These revisions would further align NPDES regulations with statutory requirements from the 1987 CWA Amendments and more recent case law requirements. By modernizing the NPDES regulations, the proposed revisions would provide NPDES permit writers with improved tools to write well-documented permits to protect human health and the environment.

Retrospective Review-Improving the Previous Participation Reviews of Prospective Multifamily Housing and Healthcare Programs Participants; Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,Proposed Rule,Housing and Urban Development Department,"On August 10, 2015, HUD published in the Federal Register, a proposed rule that would revise HUD's regulations for reviewing the previous participation of Federal programs of certain participants seeking to take part in multifamily housing and healthcare programs administered by HUD's Office of Housing. Specifically, the rulemaking proposed to clarify and simplify the process by which HUD reviews the previous participation of participants that have decision-making authority over their projects as one component of HUD's responsibility to assess financial and operational risk to the projects in these programs. The approach offered by the proposed rule was to not only bring greater certainty and clarity to the process but greater flexibility, avoiding a one-size fits all approach. This document opens the public comment period solely for the provisions addressed in this document to address concerns that while the proposed rule provided greater flexibility, it lacked the greater certainty to which HUD committed, and how HUD would provide such certainty.", 2016-11346,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/17/2016-11346/retrospective-review-improving-the-previous-participation-reviews-of-prospective-multifamily-housing,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-17/pdf/2016-11346.pdf,05/17/2016

Mandatory Deposit of Electronic Books and Sound Recordings Available Only Online,Proposed Rule,"Library of Congress; Copyright Office, Library of Congress","In 2010, the U.S. Copyright Office, acting pursuant to section 407 of title 17 and following a public rulemaking process, adopted an interim rule governing mandatory deposit of electronic works that are not available in a physical format. The interim rule refers to such works as ``electronic works published in the United States and available only online'' (or ``online-only works''). The interim rule created a limited exception to the Register's longstanding regulatory exemption that online-only works are not subject to mandatory deposit requirements. It also established best edition criteria and regulations as to electronic serials requested pursuant to section 407. The Library has adopted policies for the use of such materials, including limiting public access to deposited works to dedicated terminals located at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. These policies were anticipated and discussed during the rulemaking process, but are not memorialized in the regulations. The Library of Congress is now interested in extending the interim rule to apply to online-only books and sound recordings. Because over six years have passed since the interim rule was adopted, and because the interim rule was intended to inform a more permanent solution and rule, the Copyright Office is initiating a notice of inquiry to further guide its work in this area. The Copyright Office seeks feedback from affected communities regarding the experience with mandatory deposit of electronic serials, generally, as well as comments pertaining to the potential application of mandatory deposit to online-only books and sound recordings, specifically. Based on this feedback, the Office will solicit further written comments and/or invite stakeholder meetings before moving to a rulemaking process.", 2016-11613,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/17/2016-11613/mandatory-deposit-of-electronic-books-and-sound-recordings-available-only-online,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-17/pdf/2016-11613.pdf,05/17/2016

Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We propose to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2013-19- 04, which applies to certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, - 700C, -800, and -900 series airplanes. AD 2013-19-04 currently requires repetitive detailed and high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections for cracking of the skin around the eight fasteners common to the ends of the station (STA) 540 bulkhead chords between stringers S-22 and S- 23, left and right sides; related investigative actions and corrective actions, if necessary; and provides an optional terminating modification. Since we issued AD 2013-19-04, we have received reports of additional cracks that are larger and initiated sooner than previously predicted. This proposed AD would reduce the inspection threshold and repetitive inspection intervals. We are proposing this AD to detect and correct fatigue cracking in the fuselage skin around the eight fasteners securing the STA 540 bulkhead chords.

Restrictions on Qualified Financial Contracts of Systemically Important U.S. Banking Organizations and the U.S. Operations of Systemically Important Foreign Banking Organizations; Revisions to the Definition of Qualifying Master Netting Agreement and Related Definitions,Proposed Rule,Federal Reserve System,"The Board is inviting comment on a proposed rule to promote U.S. financial stability by improving the resolvability and resilience of systemically important U.S. banking organizations and systemically important foreign banking organizations pursuant to section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Under the proposed rule, any U.S. top-tier bank holding company identified by the Board as a global systemically important banking organization (GSIB), the subsidiaries of any U.S. GSIB (other than national banks and federal savings associations), and the U.S. operations of any foreign GSIB (other than national banks and federal savings associations) would be subjected to restrictions regarding the terms of their non-cleared qualified financial contracts (QFCs). First, a covered entity would generally be required to ensure that QFCs to which it is party, including QFCs entered into outside the United States, provide that any default rights and restrictions on the transfer of the QFCs are limited to the same extent as they would be under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Second, a covered entity would generally be prohibited from being party to QFCs that would allow a QFC counterparty to exercise default rights against the covered entity based on the entry into a resolution proceeding under the Dodd-Frank Act, Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or any other resolution proceeding of an affiliate of the covered entity. The proposal would also amend certain definitions in the Board's capital and liquidity rules; these amendments are intended to ensure that the regulatory capital and liquidity treatment of QFCs to which a covered entity is party is not affected by the proposed restrictions on such QFCs. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to issue a proposed rule that would subject national banks and federal savings associations that are GSIB subsidiaries to requirements substantively identical to those proposed here.", 2016-11209,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/11/2016-11209/restrictions-on-qualified-financial-contracts-of-systemically-important-us-banking-organizations-and,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-11/pdf/2016-11209.pdf,05/11/2016

AD 2007-11-13 currently requires revising the Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness to incorporate new removal limits for certain components of the flap system and to reduce the inspection interval s for fatigue cracking of principal structural elements (PSE). Since we issued AD 2007-11-13, a new Airworthiness Limitations Instructions (ALI) revision was released that incorporates nondestructive inspection (NDI) techniques and reduced repetitive inspection intervals for three PSEs. We have determined that these reduced intervals are necessary to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would require revising the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate reduced intervals for the inspections for three PSEs and add NDI techniques to the inspection process.

"Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Bus Emergency Exits and Window Retention and Release, Anti-Ejection Glazing for Bus Portals",Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,"This NPRM proposes a new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 217a, ``Anti-ejection glazing for bus portals,'' to drive the installation of advanced glazing in high-occupancy buses (generally, over-the-road buses (of any weight) and non-over-the-road buses with a gross vehicle weight rating greater than 11,793 kilograms (26,000 pounds). The new standard would specify impactor testing of glazing material. In the tests, a 26 kilogram (57 pound) impactor would be propelled from inside a test vehicle toward the window glazing at 21.6 kilometers/hour (13.4 miles per hour). The impactor and impact speed would simulate the loading from an average size unrestrained adult male impacting a window on the opposite side of a large bus in a rollover. Performance requirements would apply to side and rear windows, and to glass panels and windows on the roof to mitigate partial and complete ejection of passengers from these windows and to ensure that emergency exits remain operable after a rollover crash. NHTSA also proposes to limit the protrusions of emergency exit latches into emergency exit openings of windows to ensure they do not unduly hinder emergency egress. This NPRM is among the rulemakings issued pursuant to NHTSA's 2007 Approach to Motorcoach Safety and DOT's Departmental Motorcoach Safety Action Plan. In addition, to the extent warranted under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, establishing advanced glazing standards for the side and rear portals of the subject buses would fulfill a statutory provision of the Motorcoach Enhanced Safety Act of 2012 (incorporated and passed as part of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act).", 2016-10418,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/06/2016-10418/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards-bus-emergency-exits-and-window-retention-and-release,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-06/pdf/2016-10418.pdf,05/06/2016

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Maryland; State Board Requirements,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve the state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland for the purpose of updating their state board requirements. The SIP revision removes the current SIP approved state board requirements and replaces them with an updated version of the requirements. The new provisions continue to address state board requirements for all the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The revision is being done because the Maryland legislature revised Maryland's statutory requirements related to state boards and the state wants the most recent version in their SIP. In the Final Rules section of this Federal Register, EPA is approving the State's SIP submittal as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial submittal and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this action, no further activity is contemplated. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period.

"Federal Credit Union Occupancy, Planning, and Disposal of Acquired and Abandoned Premises; Incidental Powers",Proposed Rule,National Credit Union Administration,"As part of NCUA's Regulatory Modernization Initiative, the NCUA Board (Board) is issuing for public comment a proposed rule to amend its regulation governing federal credit union (FCU) occupancy, planning, and disposal of acquired and abandoned premises, and its regulation regarding incidental powers. To provide regulatory relief to FCUs, the proposal eliminates a requirement in the current occupancy rule (formerly known as the fixed assets rule) that an FCU must plan for, and eventually achieve, full occupancy of acquired premises. The proposal generally retains the current regulatory timeframes for partial occupancy. However, it modifies the definition of ``partially occupy'' to mean occupation and use, on a full-time basis, of at least fifty percent of the premises by the FCU, or by a combination of the FCU and a credit union service organization (CUSO) in which the FCU has a controlling interest in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The proposal also amends the excess capacity provision in NCUA's incidental powers rule to clarify that an FCU may lease or sell excess capacity in its facilities, but it need not anticipate that such excess capacity will be fully occupied by the FCU in the future. However, the sale or lease of excess capacity in equipment or services, including employee-sharing and data processing for third parties, continues to be limited to circumstances where an FCU reasonably anticipates that such excess capacity will be taken up by the future expansion of services to members.", 2016-09867,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/04/27/2016-09867/federal-credit-union-occupancy-planning-and-disposal-of-acquired-and-abandoned-premises-incidental,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-04-27/pdf/2016-09867.pdf,04/27/2016

Ocean Disposal; Designation of a Dredged Material Disposal Site in Eastern Region of Long Island Sound; Connecticut,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to designate one dredged material disposal site, the Eastern Long Island Sound Disposal Site (ELDS) located offshore from New London, Connecticut, for the disposal of dredged material from harbors and navigation channels in eastern Long Island Sound in the states of Connecticut and New York. This action is necessary to provide a long- term, open-water dredged material disposal site as an alternative for the possible future disposal of such material. This disposal site designation is subject to various restrictions designed to support the goal of reducing or eliminating the disposal of dredged material in Long Island Sound. While EPA is currently proposing to designate the ELDS as its preferred alternative, EPA also has concluded, based on the analysis in the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Designation of Dredged Material Disposal Site(s) in Eastern Long Island Sound, Connecticut and New York (DSEIS), that two other alternatives, the Niantic Bay and Cornfield Shoals disposal sites (NBDS and CSDS), or portions thereof, could potentially be designated in addition to, or instead of, the ELDS.

Updates to Protected Critical Infrastructure Information Program,Proposed Rule,Homeland Security Department; Office of the Secretary,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to update its procedures for accepting Critical Infrastructure Information (CII) as a step towards meeting the challenges of evolving technology and identifying ways to make the PCII Program's protective measures more effective for information-sharing partnerships between the government and the private sector. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 authorizes DHS to establish a program to accept information relating to critical infrastructure voluntarily submitted from the public, owners and operators of critical infrastructure, and State, local, tribal, and territorial governmental entities, while limiting public disclosure of that sensitive information under the Freedom of Information Act and other laws, rules, and processes. To implement this authority, DHS issued the ``Procedures for Handling Critical Infrastructure Information'' Final Rule in 2006. This Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) provides an opportunity for DHS to hear and consider, during the development of new regulations to update DHS's PCII program, the views of the private and public sector, and other interested members of the public on their recommendations for program modifications, particularly subject matter areas that have developed significantly since the issuance of the initial rule, such as automated information sharing.", 2016-09186,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/04/21/2016-09186/updates-to-protected-critical-infrastructure-information-program,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-04-21/pdf/2016-09186.pdf,04/21/2016

Amendment to the Definition of “Condition” and Prerequisite Requirement for Shell Eggs Eligible for Grading and Certification Stated in the Regulations Governing the Voluntary Grading of Shell Eggs,Proposed Rule,Agriculture Department; Agricultural Marketing Service,The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposes to amend the Regulations Governing the Voluntary Grading of Shell Eggs to clarify the definition of ``condition'' and revise the prerequisite requirement for shell eggs eligible for voluntary USDA grading and certification. The proposed revision to the prerequisite requirement will prohibit the use of Salmonella Enteritidis-adulterated or recalled shell eggs from being presented to USDA for grading and certification. AMS is proposing to revise the definition of ``condition'' to remove any food safety implications resulting from the use of the term ``wholesomeness'' and clarify that AMS' role in grading and certification of shell eggs is solely for a quality determination., 2016-09139,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/04/20/2016-09139/amendment-to-the-definition-of-condition-and-prerequisite-requirement-for-shell-eggs-eligible-for,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-04-20/pdf/2016-09139.pdf,04/20/2016

Eligibility of the Republic of Poland To Export Poultry Products to the United States,Proposed Rule,Agriculture Department; Food Safety and Inspection Service,"The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to add the Republic of Poland (Poland) to the list of countries in the regulations eligible to export poultry products to the United States. FSIS has reviewed Poland's poultry laws, regulations, and inspection system as implemented and has tentatively determined that they are equivalent to the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA), the regulations implementing this statute, and the U.S. food safety system for poultry. Should this rule become final, slaughtered poultry, or parts or other products thereof, processed in certified Polish establishments, would be eligible for export to the United States. Although Poland may be listed in FSIS's regulations as eligible to export poultry products to the United States, the products must also comply with all other applicable requirements of the United States, including those of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), before any products can enter the United States. All such products would be subject to re- inspection at U.S. ports-of-entry by FSIS inspectors.", 2016-09185,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/04/20/2016-09185/eligibility-of-the-republic-of-poland-to-export-poultry-products-to-the-united-states,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-04-20/pdf/2016-09185.pdf,04/20/2016

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We propose to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2005-15- 07, for certain Airbus Model A320-111 airplanes and Model A320-200 series airplanes. AD 2005-15-07 currently requires installing insulator and cable ties to the electrical cables of the S routes at the gaps in the raceway in the wing trailing edge and the wing tip and wing root areas. Since we issued AD 2005-15-07, we have received reports of wire chafing in the left-hand wing trailing edge. This proposed AD would require additional modifications in the trailing edges of both wings. This proposed AD would also remove airplanes from the applicability. We are proposing this AD to prevent wire chafing in the trailing edge of the wings, which could result in a short circuit in the vicinity of the fuel tanks, consequently resulting in a potential source of ignition in a fuel tank vapor space and consequent fuel tank explosion.", 2016-08953,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/04/20/2016-08953/airworthiness-directives-airbus-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-04-20/pdf/2016-08953.pdf,04/20/2016
