Ocean Disposal; Temporary Modification of an Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site in Massachusetts Bay,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a temporary modification of the boundaries of the Massachusetts Bay Dredged Material Disposal Site (MBDS) pursuant to the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), as amended. The purpose of this temporary site modification is to allow for the environmental restoration of a particular area adjacent to the MBDS (Potential Restoration Area) by temporarily expanding the boundaries of the existing MBDS. The temporary expansion is a circular area that contains the Potential Restoration Area, which includes most of the historic Industrial Waste Site (IWS). Decades ago, the IWS was used for the disposal of barrels containing industrial, chemical and low-level radioactive waste, as well as for the disposal of munitions, ordnance, construction equipment, and contaminated dredged material. The modification of the disposal site boundary will enable the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to place suitable dredged material generated from the Boston Harbor Deep Draft Navigation Project at the Potential Restoration Area in order to cover the barrels and other wastes disposed there in the past. This is expected to improve environmental conditions at the site. The Deep Draft Navigation Project includes improvement dredging of the main ship channel, which will generate approximately 11 million cubic yards (cy) of dredged material. The existing MBDS will continue to be used for disposal of other dredging projects, as usual. The expansion area will permanently close upon completion of the Boston Harbor Deep Draft Navigation Project, while the existing MBDS will remain open for the disposal of other suitable dredged material. Like the MBDS, however, the expansion area will be subject to ongoing monitoring and management to monitor the recovery of the area and to ensure continued protection of the marine environment.", 2018-11322,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/05/29/2018-11322/ocean-disposal-temporary-modification-of-an-ocean-dredged-material-disposal-site-in-massachusetts,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-05-29/pdf/2018-11322.pdf,05/29/2018

Accelerating Wireless Broadband Deployment by Removing Barriers to Infrastructure Investment,Rule,Federal Communications Commission,"In this document (Order), the Federal Communications Commission (The Commission or FCC) adopts rules to streamline the wireless infrastructure siting review process to facilitate the deployment of next-generation wireless facilities. As part of the FCC's efforts, the agency consulted with a wide range of communities to determine the appropriate steps needed to enable the rapid and efficient deployment of next-generation wireless networks--or 5G-- throughout the United States. The Order focuses on ensuring the Commission's rules properly address the differences between large and small wireless facilities, and clarifies the treatment of small cell deployments. Specifically, the Order: Excludes small wireless facilities deployed on non-Tribal lands from National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review, concluding that these facilities are not ``undertakings'' or ``major Federal actions.'' Small wireless facilities deployments continue to be subject to currently applicable state and local government approval requirements. The Order also clarifies and makes improvements to the process for Tribal participation in section 106 historic preservation reviews for large wireless facilities where NHPA/NEPA review is still required; removes the requirement that applicants file Environmental Assessments solely due to the location of a proposed facility in a floodplain, as long as certain conditions are met; and establishes timeframes for the Commission to act on Environmental Assessments. These actions will reduce regulatory impediments to deploying small cells needed for 5G and help to expand the reach of 5G for faster, more reliable wireless service and other advanced wireless technologies to more Americans.", 2018-08886,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/05/03/2018-08886/accelerating-wireless-broadband-deployment-by-removing-barriers-to-infrastructure-investment,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-05-03/pdf/2018-08886.pdf,05/03/2018

Fisheries Off West Coast States; West Coast Salmon Fisheries; 2018 Management Measures and a Temporary Rule,Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"Through this final rule, NMFS establishes fishery management measures for the 2018 ocean salmon fisheries off Washington, Oregon, and California and the 2019 salmon seasons opening earlier than May 1, 2019. The temporary rule for emergency action (emergency rule), under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), implements the 2018 annual management measures for the West Coast ocean salmon fisheries for the area from the U.S./Canada border to Cape Falcon, OR, from May 1, 2018, through October 28, 2018. The emergency rule is required because allocation of coho harvest between recreational and commercial fisheries will not be consistent with the allocation schedule specified in the Pacific Coast Salmon Fishery Management Plan (FMP) in order to limit fishery impacts on Queets and Grays Harbor coho and meet conservation and management objectives. The fishery management measures for the area from Cape Falcon, OR, to the U.S./Mexico border are consistent with the FMP and are implemented through a final rule. Specific fishery management measures vary by fishery and by area. The measures establish fishing areas, seasons, quotas, legal gear, recreational fishing days and catch limits, possession and landing restrictions, and minimum lengths for salmon taken in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (3-200 nautical miles (nmi)) off Washington, Oregon, and California. The management measures are intended to prevent overfishing and to apportion the ocean harvest equitably among treaty Indian, non-treaty commercial, and recreational fisheries. The measures are also intended to allow a portion of the salmon runs to escape the ocean fisheries in order to provide for spawning escapement and inside fisheries (fisheries occurring in state internal waters).", 2018-09164,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/05/01/2018-09164/fisheries-off-west-coast-states-west-coast-salmon-fisheries-2018-management-measures-and-a-temporary,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-05-01/pdf/2018-09164.pdf,05/01/2018

This final rule implements the C-17-02 fishing management measures for tropical tuna (i.e., bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), and skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis)) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). This final rule imposes the following on purse seine vessels with carrying capacity greater than 182 metric tons (mt) fishing for tropical tuna in the EPO: A 72-day EPO-wide closure, a 31-day area closure, and a requirement that--with some exceptions--all tropical tuna be retained and landed. In addition, this final rule revises the restrictions for exemptions due to force majeure, establishes a bigeye tuna catch limit of 750 mt for U.S. longline vessels greater than 24 meters in overall length, and regulates the use and design of fish aggregating devices.

Conforming Statutory Amendments and Technical Corrections to Small Business Government Contracting Regulations,Rule,Small Business Administration,"The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) is amending its regulations to incorporate a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 (NDAA 2018) and to update and provide several technical corrections to SBA's regulations. Specifically, the NDAA 2018 amended the Small Business Act by replacing fixed dollar amount thresholds with references to the micro-purchase and simplified acquisition thresholds. SBA is updating its regulations to conform to this new statutory language. SBA is also updating the sole source dollar amounts for the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVO) small business and the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business regulations. The thresholds for sole source contracting are contained in the Small Business Act, SBA's regulations, and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). These thresholds are updated in the FAR for inflation periodically, and therefore, over time, SBA's regulations and the FAR's numbers diverge. SBA is making this change to conform the thresholds contained in SBA's regulations to those in the FAR. This rule also allows indirect ownership by United States citizens in the HUBZone program to more accurately align with the underlying statutory authority. Finally, SBA is making several technical changes to address mistakes and typos made in previous rulemakings. For example, this final rule will update some cross-references that were not updated when a previous rulemaking changed numbering. Other changes made are for errors, grammar, syntax, and clarity.", 2018-06033,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/26/2018-06033/conforming-statutory-amendments-and-technical-corrections-to-small-business-government-contracting,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-03-26/pdf/2018-06033.pdf,03/26/2018

Hours of Service; Electronic Logging Devices; Limited 90-Day Waiver for the Transportation of Agricultural Commodities,Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,"FMCSA grants a limited 90-day waiver from the Federal hours- of-service (HOS) regulations pertaining to electronic logging devices (ELDs) for the transportation of agricultural commodities as defined in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). The Agency has determined that the waiver is in the public interest and will likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption, based on the terms and conditions imposed. The waiver provides the Agency additional time to complete its analysis of the public responses to its December 20, 2017, notice of proposed regulatory guidance to clarify the applicability of the ``Agricultural commodity'' exception to the hours- of-service regulations and issue final guidance which in turn, would have an impact on which drivers transporting agricultural commodities are required to use ELDs, and the public responses to its October 31, 2017, document announcing receipt of the NPPC's application for an exemption from the ELD requirements and to issue a decision whether to grant NPPC's request for longer-term relief from the ELD rule. The Agency has determined through its preliminary analysis of the public comments submitted to the public dockets that the issues raised by transporters of agricultural commodities are more complex than those raised by other segments of the industry seeking relief from the ELD requirements and that it is appropriate to take additional time to bring these matters to closure.", 2018-05865,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/23/2018-05865/hours-of-service-electronic-logging-devices-limited-90-day-waiver-for-the-transportation-of,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-03-23/pdf/2018-05865.pdf,03/23/2018

Pacific Halibut Fisheries; Catch Sharing Plan,Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS is implementing this interim final rule to establish regulations for 2018 Pacific halibut catch limits in the following International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) Regulatory Areas: Area 2C (Southeast Alaska), Area 3A (Central Gulf of Alaska), Area 3B (Western Gulf of Alaska), and Area 4 (subdivided into five areas, 4A through 4E, in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands of Western Alaska). This interim final rule revises a catch sharing plan (CSP) for guided sport (charter) and commercial individual fishing quota (IFQ) halibut fisheries in Area 2C and Area 3A, revises regulations applicable to the charter halibut fisheries in Area 2C and Area 3A, and revises a CSP for the commercial IFQ and Western Alaska Community Development Quota (CDQ) halibut fisheries in Areas 4C, 4D, and 4E. This action is necessary because the IPHC, at its annual meeting, did not recommend new catch limits or specific CSP allocations and charter management measures for Areas 2C, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, and 4E for 2018, and the 2017 IPHC regulations are in effect until superseded. This interim final rule is necessary because immediate action is needed to ensure that halibut catch limits, charter halibut fishery management measures, and CSP allocations are in place at the start of the commercial IFQ and CDQ halibut fishery on March 24, 2018, that better protect the declining Pacific halibut resource.

Marine Casualty Reporting Property Damage Thresholds,Rule,Homeland Security Department; Coast Guard,"The Coast Guard is amending the monetary property damage threshold amounts for reporting a marine casualty and for reporting a type of marine casualty called a ``serious marine incident.'' The original regulations that set these dollar threshold amounts were written in the 1980s and have not been updated since that time. Because the monetary thresholds for reporting have not kept pace with inflation, vessel owners and operators have been required to report relatively minor casualties. Additionally, the original regulations require mandatory drug and alcohol testing following a serious marine incident. As a result, vessel owners and operators are conducting testing for casualties that are less significant than those intended to be captured by the original regulations.

We are also reclassifying Swallenia alexandrae (with a common name of Eureka dune grass, Eureka dunegrass, or Eureka Valley dune grass) from an endangered to a threatened species. For Eureka Valley evening- primrose, this action is based on our evaluation of the best available scientific and commercial information, including comments received, which indicates that the threats have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the subspecies no longer meets the definition of an endangered species or a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). For Eureka dune grass, this reclassification is based on our evaluation of the best available scientific and commercial information, including comments received. We conclude that the stressors acting upon Eureka dune grass are of sufficient imminence, scope, or magnitude to indicate that they are continuing to result in impacts at either the population or rangewide scales, albeit to a lesser degree than at the time of listing, and we find that Eureka dune grass meets the statutory definition of a threatened species (i.e., the stressors impacting the species or its habitat are of sufficient magnitude, scope, or imminence to indicate that the species is likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range).", 2018-03769,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-03769/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-removing-oenothera-avita-ssp-eurekensis-from-the,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-02-27/pdf/2018-03769.pdf,02/27/2018

Fisheries Off West Coast States; Coastal Pelagic Species Fisheries; Amendment 16 to the Coastal Pelagic Species Fishery Management Plan,Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS is publishing this final rule to implement Amendment 16 of the Coastal Pelagic Species (CPS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP). This rule will allow for very small amounts of directed, non-live bait fishing (referred to as ``minor directed fishing'') on CPS finfish to occur when a fishery is otherwise closed to directed fishing. Currently, when directed fishing is closed, a small sector of the CPS fishery that is not part of the primary commercial directed fishery has been precluded from landing even minor amounts because this activity does not fall under the existing exemptions for incidental harvest or for harvesting CPS to be sold as live bait. This rule allows this sector to continue directed fishing after other directed fisheries are closed, unless otherwise specified in a closure notice published by NMFS or if an applicable annual catch limit (ACL) is anticipated to be exceeded. To prevent exploitation of this rule to make large aggregate harvests, ``minor directed fishing'' would not be allowed to exceed landings of 1 metric ton (mt) per day per vessel or person or one fishing trip per day by any vessel. The purpose of this rule is to provide greater flexibility to small fishing operations, while continuing to conserve the target CPS fish stocks.", 2018-03040,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/14/2018-03040/fisheries-off-west-coast-states-coastal-pelagic-species-fisheries-amendment-16-to-the-coastal,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-02-14/pdf/2018-03040.pdf,02/14/2018
