Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; State of Texas; Regional Haze and Interstate Visibility Transport Federal Implementation Plan,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"Pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA or Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a partial approval of the 2009 Texas Regional Haze State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission and a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Texas to address certain outstanding requirements. Specifically, the EPA is finalizing determinations regarding best available retrofit technology (BART) for electric generating units (EGUs) in the State of Texas. To address the BART requirement for sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), the EPA is finalizing an alternative to BART that consists of an intrastate trading program addressing the SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from certain EGUs. To address the BART requirement for oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>), we are finalizing our proposed determination that Texas' participation in the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule's (CSAPR) trading program for ozone-season NO<INF>X</INF> qualifies as an alternative to BART. We are approving Texas' determination that its EGUs are not subject to BART for particulate matter (PM). Finally, we are disapproving portions of several SIP revisions submitted to satisfy the CAA requirement to address interstate visibility transport for six national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS): 1997 8-hour ozone, 1997 fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) (annual and 24-hour), 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> (24-hour), 2008 8-hour ozone, 2010 1-hour nitrogen dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>) and 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF>.

Air Plan Approval; Georgia; Cross-State Air Pollution Rule,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving portions of a revision to the Georgia State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) that was submitted by Georgia on July 26, 2017. Under CSAPR, large electricity generating units (EGUs) in Georgia are subject to Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) requiring the units to participate in CSAPR's federal trading program for annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), one of CSAPR's two federal trading programs for annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), and one of CSAPR's two federal trading programs for ozone season emissions of NO<INF>X</INF>. This action approves the State's regulations requiring large Georgia EGUs to participate in new CSAPR state trading programs for annual NO<INF>X</INF>, annual SO<INF>2</INF>, and ozone season NO<INF>X</INF> emissions integrated with the CSAPR federal trading programs, replacing the corresponding FIP requirements. Under the CSAPR regulations, approval of these portions of the SIP revision automatically eliminates Georgia's units' obligations under the corresponding CSAPR FIPs addressing interstate transport requirements for the 1997 Annual Fine Particulate Matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, and the 1997 8-hour Ozone NAAQS.

Under CSAPR, large electricity generating units (EGUs) in South Carolina are subject to Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) requiring the units to participate in CSAPR's federal trading program for annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and one of CSAPR's two federal trading programs for annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>). This action approves the State's regulations requiring large South Carolina EGUs to participate in new CSAPR state trading programs for annual NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> emissions integrated with the CSAPR federal trading programs and incorporates them into South Carolina's SIP, replacing the corresponding FIP requirements. These CSAPR state trading programs are substantively identical to the CSAPR federal trading programs, with the State retaining EPA's default allowance allocation methodology and EPA remaining the implementing authority for administration of the trading program. Under the CSAPR regulations, approval of these portions of the SIP revision automatically eliminates South Carolina units' obligations to participate in CSAPR's federal trading programs for annual NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> emissions under the corresponding CSAPR FIPs addressing interstate transport requirements for the 1997 Annual Fine Particulate Matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).

Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter: Revision of Federal Implementation Plan Requirements for Texas,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing withdrawal of the federal implementation plan (FIP) provisions that require affected electricity generating units (EGUs) in Texas to participate in Phase 2 of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) trading programs for annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) and nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>). Withdrawal of the FIP requirements is intended to address a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) remanding the CSAPR Phase 2 SO<INF>2</INF> budget for Texas to the EPA for reconsideration. With this action, the EPA is also determining that, following withdrawal of the FIP requirements, sources in Texas do not contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other state with regard to the 1997 national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>). Accordingly, we are also determining that the EPA has no obligation to issue new FIP requirements for Texas sources to address transported PM<INF>2.5</INF> pollution under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) with regard to that NAAQS. Finally, the EPA is also affirming the continued validity of the Agency's 2012 determination that participation in CSAPR meets the Regional Haze Rule's criteria for an alternative to the application of source- specific best available retrofit technology (BART). The EPA has determined that changes to CSAPR's geographic scope resulting from the actions EPA has taken or expects to take in response to the D.C. Circuit's remand do not affect the continued validity of participation in CSAPR as a BART alternative, because the changes in geographic scope would not have adversely affected the results of the air quality modeling analysis upon which the EPA based the 2012 determination.", 2017-20832,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/09/29/2017-20832/interstate-transport-of-fine-particulate-matter-revision-of-federal-implementation-plan-requirements,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-09-29/pdf/2017-20832.pdf,09/29/2017

Postponement of Certain Compliance Dates for the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"Under the Clean Water Act (``CWA''), The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to conduct a rulemaking to potentially revise certain best available technology economically achievable (``BAT'') effluent limitations and pretreatment standards for existing sources (``PSES'') for the steam electric power generating point source category, which were published in the Federal Register on November 3, 2015. EPA is, accordingly, postponing the associated compliance dates in the 2015 Rule. In particular, EPA is postponing the earliest compliance dates for the new, more stringent, BAT effluent limitations and PSES for flue gas desulfurization (``FGD'') wastewater and bottom ash transport water in the 2015 Rule for a period of two years. At this time, EPA does not intend to conduct a rulemaking that would potentially revise the new, more stringent BAT effluent limitations and pretreatment standards in the 2015 Rule for fly ash transport water, flue gas mercury control wastewater, and gasification wastewater, or any of the other requirements in the 2015 Rule. As such, EPA is not changing the compliance dates for the BAT limitations and PSES established by the 2015 Rule for these wastestreams. EPA's action to postpone certain compliance dates in the 2015 Rule is intended to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water until EPA completes its next rulemaking concerning those wastestreams, and it thus does not otherwise amend the effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the steam electric power generating point source category.", 2017-19821,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/09/18/2017-19821/postponement-of-certain-compliance-dates-for-the-effluent-limitations-guidelines-and-standards-for,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-09-18/pdf/2017-19821.pdf,09/18/2017

Under the final rule, any U.S. top-tier bank holding company identified by the Board as a global systemically important banking organization (GSIB), the subsidiaries of any U.S. GSIB (other than national banks, federal savings associations, state nonmember banks, and state savings associations), and the U.S. operations of any foreign GSIB (other than national banks, federal savings associations, state nonmember banks, and state savings associations) would be subjected to restrictions regarding the terms of their non-cleared qualified financial contracts (QFCs). First, a covered entity generally is required to ensure that QFCs to which it is party provide that any default rights and restrictions on the transfer of the QFCs are limited to the same extent as they would be under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Second, a covered entity generally is prohibited from being party to QFCs that would allow a QFC counterparty to exercise default rights against the covered entity, directly or indirectly, based on the entry into a resolution proceeding under the Dodd-Frank Act or Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or any other resolution proceeding, of an affiliate of the covered entity. The final rule also amends certain definitions in the Board's capital and liquidity rules; these amendments are intended to ensure that the regulatory capital and liquidity treatment of QFCs to which a covered entity is party is not affected by the final rule's restrictions on such QFCs. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are expected to issue final rules that would subject GSIB subsidiaries for which the OCC and FDIC are the appropriate Federal banking agency to requirements substantively identical to those in this final rule.", 2017-19053,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/09/12/2017-19053/restrictions-on-qualified-financial-contracts-of-systemically-important-us-banking-organizations-and,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-09-12/pdf/2017-19053.pdf,09/12/2017

Procedures for Chemical Risk Evaluation Under the Amended Toxic Substances Control Act,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"As required under section 6(b)(4) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), EPA is issuing a rule that establishes a process for conducting risk evaluations to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other non-risk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation, under the conditions of use. This process incorporates the science requirements of the amended statute, including best available science and weight of the scientific evidence. Risk evaluation is the second step, after Prioritization, in a new process of existing chemical substance review and management established under recent amendments to TSCA. This rule identifies the steps of a risk evaluation process including: scope, hazard assessment, exposure assessment, risk characterization, and finally a risk determination. This process will be used for the first ten chemical substances undergoing evaluation from the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments (to the maximum extent practicable).
