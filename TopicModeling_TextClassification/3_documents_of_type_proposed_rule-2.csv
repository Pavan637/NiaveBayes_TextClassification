Small-Scale Natural Gas Exports,Proposed Rule,Energy Department,"The Department of Energy (DOE or Department) proposes to revise its regulations to provide that DOE will issue an export authorization upon receipt of any complete application that seeks to export natural gas, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), to countries with which the United States has not entered into a free trade agreement (FTA) requiring national treatment for trade in natural gas and with which trade is not prohibited by U.S. law or policy (non-FTA countries), provided that the application satisfies the following two criteria: The application proposes to export natural gas in a volume up to and including 0.14 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day (Bcf/d), and DOE's approval of the application does not require an environmental impact statement (EIS) or an environmental assessment (EA) under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). In proposing this revision, DOE is interpreting the phrase ``public interest'' set forth in the Natural Gas Act (NGA). DOE proposes that applications that satisfy these criteria are requesting authorization for ``small-scale natural gas exports'' and, as such, the exports are deemed to be consistent with the public interest under the NGA.

VA Veteran-Owned Small Business Verification Guidelines,Proposed Rule,Veterans Affairs Department,"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) published a rule in the Federal Register on November 6, 2015, 80 FR 68795 that proposed amending its regulations governing the VA's Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) Verification Program. The Verification Program has been the subject of reports from both the Government Accountability Office and VA's Office of Inspector General stating that despite VA's Verification Program, fraud still exists in the Veterans First Contracting Program. Some stakeholder feedback has been that the current regulation is too open to interpretation and is unnecessarily more rigorous than similar certification programs run by the United State Small Business Administration (SBA). The proposed rule sought to clarify the eligibility requirements for businesses to obtain ``verified'' status, added and revised definitions, reordered requirements, redefined the definition of ``control,'' and provided explanatory information on VA's examination and review processes and procedures. The proposed rule additionally sought to implement new changes to community property restrictions, unconditional ownership, and day-to-day requirements and full-time requirements. An exception for majority, supermajority, unanimous, and other voting provisions for extraordinary business decisions were also proposed. Comments to the proposed rule were to be provided to the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization on or before January 5, 2016. Due to the nature of the adverse comments received, VA has determined not to pursue implementation of the rule as originally proposed. Accordingly, this document withdraws the proposed rule.", 2017-18543,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/09/01/2017-18543/va-veteran-owned-small-business-verification-guidelines,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-09-01/pdf/2017-18543.pdf,09/01/2017

Regulatory Capital Rules: Retention of Certain Existing Transition Provisions for Banking Organizations That Are Not Subject to the Advanced Approaches Capital Rules,Proposed Rule,Treasury Department; Comptroller of the Currency; Federal Reserve System; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are inviting public comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) that would extend the current treatment under the regulatory capital rules (capital rules) for certain regulatory capital deductions and risk weights and certain minority interest requirements, as they apply to banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rules (non-advanced approaches banking organizations). Specifically, for non-advanced approaches banking organizations, the agencies propose to extend the current regulatory capital treatment of: Mortgage servicing assets; deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks; significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock; non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions; significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that are not in the form of common stock; and common equity tier 1 minority interest, tier 1 minority interest, and total capital minority interest exceeding the capital rules' minority interest limitations. The agencies expect in the near term to issue a separate NPR seeking public comment on a proposal to simplify the regulatory capital treatment of these items. Providing the proposed extension to non-advanced approaches banking organizations for these items would avoid potential burden on banking organizations that may be subject in the near future to a different regulatory capital treatment for these items.", 2017-17822,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/25/2017-17822/regulatory-capital-rules-retention-of-certain-existing-transition-provisions-for-banking,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-08-25/pdf/2017-17822.pdf,08/25/2017
"Airworthiness Directives; Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A., Turboshaft Engines",Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We propose to supersede airworthiness directive (AD) 2013-11- 09 that applies to all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A., Arrius 2B1 and 2F turboshaft engines.

National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Manufacture of Amino/Phenolic Resins,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"On October 8, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Manufacture of Amino/Phenolic Resins (APR). Subsequently, the EPA received three petitions for reconsideration of the final rule. The EPA is reconsidering and requesting public comment on issues related to the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for continuous process vents (CPVs) at existing affected sources. The EPA is proposing to revise the MACT standard for back-end CPVs at existing affected sources based on hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions test data for back-end CPVs at existing sources for this source category submitted by petitioners. The EPA is also soliciting comments regarding the need to revise the standard for front-end CPVs at existing sources, and to extend the compliance date for the proposed revised emission limit for back-end CPVs at existing sources. Additionally, the EPA is proposing requirements for storage vessels at new and existing sources during periods when an emission control system used to control vents on fixed roof tanks is undergoing planned routine maintenance. The EPA is seeking comments only on the four issues specifically addressed in this notice: proposed revised back-end CPV MACT standards for existing sources, whether the EPA should modify the front-end CPV MACT standards for existing sources, whether the EPA should extend the compliance date for the proposed revised back-end CPV MACT standards for existing sources, and the proposed work practice standards for storage vessels during planned routine maintenance of emission control systems. In this rulemaking, the EPA is not reopening or requesting comment on any other aspects of the 2014 final amendments to the NESHAP for the Manufacture of APR, including other issues raised in petitions for reconsideration of the 2014 rule. The EPA estimates this proposal, if finalized as proposed, would reduce compliance costs to this industry by $2.1 million per year, compared to a revised cost estimate of the MACT standard as amended in 2014.", 2017-17514,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/24/2017-17514/national-emission-standards-for-hazardous-air-pollutants-manufacture-of-aminophenolic-resins,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-08-24/pdf/2017-17514.pdf,08/24/2017

The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies publish semiannual regulatory agendas in the Federal Register describing regulatory actions they are developing that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (5 U.S.C. 602). In the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda) agencies report regulatory actions upcoming in the next year. Executive Order 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' signed September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51735), and Office of Management and Budget memoranda implementing section 4 of that Order establish minimum standards for agencies' agendas, including specific types of information for each entry. The Unified Agenda helps agencies fulfill these requirements. All Federal regulatory agencies have chosen to publish their regulatory agendas as part of the Unified Agenda. The complete update of the 2017 Unified Agenda contains the regulatory agendas for 66 Federal agencies, is available to the public at http://reginfo.gov. The Update to the 2017 Unified Agenda publication appearing in the Federal Register consists of agency regulatory flexibility agendas, in accordance with the publication requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Under CSAPR, large electricity generating units (EGUs) in Alabama are subject to FIP provisions requiring the units to participate in a federal allowance trading program for ozone season emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>). This action would approve into Alabama's SIP the State's regulations requiring Alabama's affected units to participate in a new state allowance trading program for ozone season NO<INF>X</INF> emissions integrated with the CSAPR federal trading programs, replacing the corresponding CSAPR FIP requirements for Alabama. This state trading program is substantively identical to the federal trading program except with regard to the provisions allocating emission allowances among Alabama units. Under the CSAPR regulations, final approval of these portions of the SIP revisions would automatically eliminate Alabama units' FIP requirements to participate in CSAPR's federal allowance trading program for ozone season NO<INF>X</INF> emissions. Approval would also fully satisfy Alabama's good neighbor obligation under the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) to prohibit emissions which will significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 1997 8-hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in any other state; and would partially satisfy Alabama's good neighbor obligation under the CAA to prohibit emissions which will significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the 2008 8-hour Ozone NAAQS in any other state.", 2017-17341,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/17/2017-17341/air-plan-approval-alabama-cross-state-air-pollution-rule,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-08-17/pdf/2017-17341.pdf,08/17/2017

Simplifying Deposit Requirements for Certain Literary Works and Musical Compositions,Proposed Rule,"Library of Congress; Copyright Office, Library of Congress","The United States Copyright Office is proposing to amend the regulations governing the deposit requirements for certain types of literary works and musical compositions. Specifically, the proposed rule will apply to certain types of ``literary monographs,'' which are defined, in part, as literary works published in one volume or a finite number of separate volumes. The proposed rule also applies to musical compositions that are published in the United States in print formats-- that is, compositions published as ``copies'' rather than solely as phonorecords, as referenced in the Copyright Act. Under the current regulations, two copies of the best edition are generally needed to register these types of works and to comply with the mandatory deposit requirement. Under the proposed rule, copyright owners will be able to satisfy both requirements for literary monographs by submitting one copy of the best edition of the work, although the Office will retain the right to demand a second copy under the mandatory deposit provision should the Library need it. Copyright owners will also be able to satisfy both requirements for certain musical compositions by submitting one copy of the best edition. As part of these changes, the proposed rule also clarifies the deposit requirements for musical compositions published both in print and phonorecord formats. For musical works (i.e., musical compositions) published in both formats, the Office will require the submission of the print version for purposes of copyright registration. If the musical composition is published only as a phonorecord, the applicant should submit the phonorecord. All of these changes will improve the efficiency of registration and mandatory deposit for both the Office and copyright owners alike, ensuring that the Office has an adequate registration record and continuing to make these works available to the Library of Congress when needed for use in its collections or other disposition. The Office invites public comment on this proposal.", 2017-17194,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/16/2017-17194/simplifying-deposit-requirements-for-certain-literary-works-and-musical-compositions,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-08-16/pdf/2017-17194.pdf,08/16/2017

Air Plan Approval; Georgia; Cross-State Air Pollution Rule,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve portions of a revision to the Georgia State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) that was submitted by Georgia on July 26, 2017. Under CSAPR, large electricity generating units (EGUs) in Georgia are subject to Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) requiring the units to participate in CSAPR's federal trading program for annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), one of CSAPR's two federal trading programs for annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), and one of CSAPR's two federal trading programs for ozone season emissions of NO<INF>X</INF>. This action would approve the State's regulations requiring large Georgia EGUs to participate in new CSAPR state trading programs for annual NO<INF>X</INF>, annual SO<INF>2</INF>, and ozone season NO<INF>X</INF> emissions integrated with the CSAPR federal trading programs, replacing the corresponding FIP requirements. EPA is proposing to approve the portions of the SIP revision concerning these CSAPR state trading programs because these portions of the SIP revision meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) and EPA's regulations for approval of a CSAPR full SIP revision replacing the requirements of a CSAPR FIP. Under the CSAPR regulations, approval of these portions of the SIP revision would automatically eliminate Georgia's units' obligations under the corresponding CSAPR FIPs addressing interstate transport requirements for the 1997 Annual Fine Particulate Matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, and the 1997 8-hour Ozone NAAQS. Approval of these portions of the SIP revision would satisfy Georgia's good neighbor obligation for the 1997 Annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, and the 1997 8-hour Ozone NAAQS. In addition, approval of this revision would remove from Georgia's SIP those state trading program rules adopted to comply with CAIR.", 2017-17227,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/16/2017-17227/air-plan-approval-georgia-cross-state-air-pollution-rule,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-08-16/pdf/2017-17227.pdf,08/16/2017

Air Plan Approval; South Carolina; Cross-State Air Pollution Rule,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve portions of a draft revision to the South Carolina State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) that was submitted by South Carolina for parallel processing on May 26, 2017. Under CSAPR, large electricity generating units (EGUs) in South Carolina are subject to Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) requiring the units to participate in CSAPR's federal trading program for annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) and one of CSAPR's two federal trading programs for annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>). This action would approve the State's regulations requiring large South Carolina EGUs to participate in new CSAPR state trading programs for annual NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> emissions integrated with the CSAPR federal trading programs, replacing the corresponding FIP requirements. These CSAPR state trading programs are substantively identical to the CSAPR federal trading programs, with the State retaining EPA's default allowance allocation methodology and EPA remaining the implementing authority for administration of the trading program. EPA is proposing to approve the portions of the draft SIP revision concerning these CSAPR state trading programs because these portions of the draft SIP revision meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) and EPA's regulations for approval of a CSAPR full SIP revision replacing the requirements of a CSAPR FIP. Under the CSAPR regulations, approval of these portions of the draft SIP revision would automatically eliminate South Carolina units' obligations to participate in CSAPR's federal trading programs for annual NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> emissions under the corresponding CSAPR FIPs addressing interstate transport requirements for the 1997 Annual Fine Particulate Matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).

National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Off-Site Waste and Recovery Operations,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"This action proposes amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Off-Site Waste and Recovery Operations (OSWRO). The proposed amendments address an issue related to monitoring pressure relief devices (PRDs) on containers. This issue was raised in a petition for reconsideration of the amendments to the OSWRO NESHAP finalized in 2015 based on the residual risk and technology review (RTR). Among other things, the 2015 amendments established additional monitoring requirements for all PRDs, including PRDs on containers. For PRDs on containers, these monitoring requirements were in addition to the inspection and monitoring requirements for containers and their closure devices, which include PRDs that were already required by the OSWRO NESHAP. This proposed action would remove the additional monitoring requirements for PRDs on containers that resulted from the 2015 amendments because we have determined that they are not necessary. This action, if finalized as proposed, would not substantially change the level of environmental protection provided under the OSWRO NESHAP. The proposed amendments would reduce capital costs related to compliance to this industry by $28 million compared to the current rule. Total annualized costs, at an interest rate of 7 percent, would be reduced by $4.2 million per year. These costs are associated with a present value of $39 million dollars, discounted at 7 percent over 15 years.", 2017-16494,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/07/2017-16494/national-emission-standards-for-hazardous-air-pollutants-off-site-waste-and-recovery-operations,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-08-07/pdf/2017-16494.pdf,08/07/2017

The NPRM also proposed to amend language for consistency with other TFR provisions and commercial space regulations and definitions by replacing ``space flight operations'' with ``launch, reentry, or amateur rocket operations.'' The intended effect of the proposed action was to further enhance the safety in the affected airspace and improve the readability of the TFR requirements. After further review of this action and the changing technology and scope of new flight operations, the FAA determined that a better assessment of TFRs in the National Air Space (NAS) is needed to address present day operations; therefore, it is withdrawing this NPRM.", 2017-16198,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/02/2017-16198/temporary-flight-restrictions-in-the-proximity-of-launch-and-reentry-operations-withdrawal,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-08-02/pdf/2017-16198.pdf,08/02/2017

This will extend the time period in which a credit union's net worth is projected to either render it insolvent or drop below two percent from 24 to 30 months and from 12 to 18 months, respectively. Additionally, the Board proposes to add a fourth category to the three existing net worth categories to include credit unions that have been granted or received assistance under section 208 of the Federal Credit Union Act (FCU Act) in the 15 months prior to the Region's determination that the credit union is in danger of insolvency.", 2017-15685,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/07/31/2017-15685/emergency-mergers-chartering-and-field-of-membership,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-07-31/pdf/2017-15685.pdf,07/31/2017

"Approval of California Air Plan Revisions, Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District",Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve and conditionally approve revisions to the Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District (AVAQMD or ``District'') portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern the District's demonstration regarding Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements for the 1997 8-hour ozone and the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS or ``standard'') in the Antelope Valley ozone nonattainment area. The EPA previously proposed to partially approve and partially disapprove AVAQMD's RACT SIP submittals for the 1997 and 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS (2006 and 2015 RACT SIPs) because we found that existing District rules implemented RACT for many, but not all, applicable sources. The AVAQMD has since addressed or committed to address these deficiencies. Therefore, we withdraw our previous proposed partial approval and partial disapproval of the AVAQMD 2006 and 2015 RACT SIPs, and now propose to partially approve and partially conditionally approve them into the California SIP. The EPA is also proposing to approve AVAQMD negative declarations into the SIP for the 1997 and the 2008 ozone standards. We are proposing action on local SIP revisions under the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).

In many cases, the perpetrators block the Caller ID information, making it difficult to trace the threatening calls. The Commission's current rules require that carriers not reveal blocked Caller ID information or use that information to allow the called party to contact the caller.

Labeling Relief; Formaldehyde Emission Standards for Composite Wood Products,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"EPA is proposing to amend a final rule that published in the Federal Register on December 12, 2016 concerning formaldehyde emission standards for composite wood products. The proposed amendment would allow compliant composite wood products and finished goods that contain compliant composite wood products that were manufactured prior to December 12, 2017 to be labeled as Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Title VI compliant. This means that regulated composite wood products and finished goods that meet the required formaldehyde emissions standards could be voluntarily labeled as compliant as soon as compliance can be achieved. This would enhance regulatory flexibility and facilitate a smoother supply chain transition to compliance with the rule's broader requirements, as well as promote lower formaldehyde emitting products entering commerce earlier than under the rule as originally published.

This SIP revision pertains to the requirements for reasonably available control technology (RACT) controls for certain sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under the 1997 ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). This SIP revision includes Pennsylvania's certification that previously adopted RACT controls in Pennsylvania's SIP that were approved by EPA under the 1-hour ozone NAAQS are based on the currently available technically and economically feasible controls, and that they continue to represent RACT for the 1997 ozone NAAQS and a negative declaration that certain categories of sources do not exist in Pennsylvania. This SIP revision does not address Pennsylvania's May 2016 VOC and nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) RACT rule, ``Additional RACT Requirements for Major Sources of NO<INF>X</INF> and VOCs,'' also known as RACT II. EPA will take separate action on RACT II. In the Final Rules section of this Federal Register, EPA is approving the State's SIP submittal as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial submittal and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this action, no further activity is contemplated. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule.

Eligibility of the People's Republic of China (PRC) To Export to the United States Poultry Products From Birds Slaughtered in the PRC,Proposed Rule,Agriculture Department; Food Safety and Inspection Service,"The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the poultry products inspection regulations to list the PRC as eligible to export to the United States poultry products from birds slaughtered in the PRC. The PRC is currently eligible to export processed poultry products to the United States if the products are derived from poultry slaughtered in the United States or in other countries eligible to slaughter and export poultry to the United States. FSIS is proposing this action because the Agency has reviewed the PRC's laws, regulations, and poultry slaughter inspection system as implemented and has determined that the PRC's poultry slaughter inspection system is equivalent to the system that the United States has established under the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) and its implementing regulations. Should this rule become final, slaughtered poultry, or parts or other products thereof, processed in certified PRC establishments, would be eligible for export to the United States.

"Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources: Three Month Stay of Certain Requirements",Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to stay for three months certain requirements that are contained within the Final Rule titled ``Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources,'' published in the Federal Register on June 3, 2016 (2016 Rule). On June 5, 2017, the EPA published a notice that, in accordance with the Clean Air Act (CAA), the EPA stayed for three initial months the fugitive emissions requirements, well site pneumatic pump standards, and requirements for certification of closed vent systems by a professional engineer. The EPA granted reconsideration after considering specific objections to these requirements. In a separate notice published today, the EPA is proposing a stay for two years, providing the EPA sufficient time to propose, take public comment, and issue a final action on the issues concerning the specific requirements on which EPA has granted reconsideration. The two-year proposed stay published today, if finalized as proposed, would likely be determined to be a major rule under the Congressional Review Act and therefore will not take effect until sixty days after publication or after Congress receives the rule report, whichever is later. Therefore, while the EPA intends to complete that rulemaking and take final action before the initial three-month stay expires, there may potentially be a gap between the two stays due to the sixty-day delay in effectiveness of that action. To avoid such a potential gap, and the resulting confusion, in this action the EPA is proposing a three-month stay which would not qualify as a major rule and could become effective upon publication. The EPA prepared an Economic Impact Analysis for this proposal, which is available in Docket ID EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0346. The EPA is seeking comment pertaining to this stay and its duration. The EPA is also seeking comment on if a four-month stay may be more appropriate to ensure continuity of the stay. The EPA is not taking comment at this time on substantive issues concerning these requirements, or on any of the other provisions subject to the reconsideration.", 2017-12473,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/06/16/2017-12473/oil-and-natural-gas-sector-emission-standards-for-new-reconstructed-and-modified-sources-three-month,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-06-16/pdf/2017-12473.pdf,06/16/2017

During this time, the EPA also plans to complete its reconsideration process for all remaining issues raised in these reconsideration petitions regarding fugitive emissions, pneumatic pumps, and certification by professional engineer requirements. The EPA acknowledges that the administrative reconsideration petitions include additional issues regarding these three requirements other than the issues for which we specifically have granted reconsideration. In addition, since the publication of the 2016 Rule, the EPA has received numerous questions relative to the implementation of these three requirements. During the reconsideration proceeding, the EPA intends to look broadly at the entire 2016 Rule. The EPA believes that addressing all of these issues at the same time would provide clarity and certainty for the public and the regulated community with regard to these requirements.

Fisheries Off West Coast States; Coastal Pelagic Species Fisheries; Annual Specifications,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS proposes to implement annual management measures and harvest specifications to establish the allowable catch levels (i.e., annual catch limit (ACL)/harvest guideline (HG)) for the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (hereafter, Pacific sardine), in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off the Pacific coast for the fishing season of July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018. This rule is proposed according to the Coastal Pelagic Species (CPS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The proposed action would prohibit directed non- tribal Pacific sardine commercial fishing for Pacific sardine off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, which is required because the estimated 2017 biomass of Pacific sardine has dropped below the biomass threshold specified in the HG control rule. Under the proposed action, Pacific sardine may still be harvested as part of either the live bait or tribal fishery, or as incidental catch in other fisheries; the incidental harvest of Pacific sardine would initially be limited to 40-percent by weight of all fish per trip when caught with other CPS or up to 2 metric tons (mt) when caught with non-CPS. The proposed annual catch limit (ACL) for the 2017-2018 Pacific sardine fishing year is 8,000 mt.

Safety Standard Addressing Blade-Contact Injuries on Table Saws,Proposed Rule,Consumer Product Safety Commission,"The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has determined preliminarily that there may be an unreasonable risk of blade-contact injuries associated with table saws. In 2015, there were an estimated 33,400 table saw, emergency department-treated injuries. Of these, CPSC staff estimates that 30,800 (92 percent) are likely related to the victim making contact with the saw blade. CPSC staff's review of the existing data indicates that currently available safety devices, such as the modular blade guard and riving knife, do not adequately address the unreasonable risk of blade-contact injuries on table saws. To address this risk, the Commission proposes a rule that is based, in part, on work conducted by Underwriters Laboratories Inc. The proposed rule would establish a performance standard that requires table saws, when powered on, to limit the depth of cut to 3.5 millimeters when a test probe, acting as surrogate for a human body/finger, contacts the spinning blade at a radial approach rate of 1 meter per second (m/s). The proposed rule would address an estimated 54,800 medically treated blade-contact injuries annually. The Commission estimates that the proposed rule's aggregate net benefits on an annual basis could range from about $625 million to about $2,300 million.", 2017-09098,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/05/12/2017-09098/safety-standard-addressing-blade-contact-injuries-on-table-saws,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-05-12/pdf/2017-09098.pdf,05/12/2017

Air Plan Approval; Rhode Island; Repeal of NOX,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Rhode Island. This revision removes Air Pollution Control (APC) Regulation 41, entitled ``NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program'' (Rhode Island NBP) from the Rhode Island SIP. The Rhode Island NBP was a market-based cap and trade program, which was created to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) from power plants and other large combustion sources in response to EPA's 1998 NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call. By 2009, EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) had effectively replaced NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Programs in eastern states. CAIR has since been replaced by the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), which was first implemented on January 1, 2015. Rhode Island was not covered by CAIR or CSAPR. The State's NBP was repealed under state law effective July 29, 2014. The five sources meeting the NBP applicability criteria have Title V permits, which contain SIP-derived NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limits, that limit their NO<INF>X</INF> emissions below the maximum emissions (936 tons) that were allowed under the Rhode Island NBP and, therefore, the requirements of the NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call are satisfied by the emissions limits contained in those sources' permits. This renders Regulation 41 unnecessary.

Safety Standard for Infant Inclined Sleep Products,Proposed Rule,Consumer Product Safety Commission,"The Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act, section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), requires the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) to promulgate consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products. These standards are to be ``substantially the same as'' applicable voluntary standards, or more stringent than the voluntary standard if the Commission concludes that more stringent requirements would further reduce the risk of injury associated with the product. The Commission is proposing a safety standard for infant inclined sleep products (inclined sleep products) in response to the direction under section 104(b) of the CPSIA.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Threatened Species Status for the Headwater Chub and Roundtail Chub Distinct Population Segment,Proposed Rule,Interior Department; Fish and Wildlife Service,"We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), withdraw the proposed rule to list the headwater chub (Gila nigra) and a distinct population segment (DPS) of the roundtail chub (Gila robusta) from the lower Colorado River basin as threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (Act). This withdrawal is based on a thorough review of the best scientific and commercial data available, which indicate that the headwater chub and the roundtail chub DPS are not discrete taxonomic entities and do not meet the definition of a species under the Act. These fish are now recognized as a part of a single taxonomic species--the roundtail chub (Gila robusta). Because the entities previously proposed for listing are no longer recognized as species, as defined by the Act, we have determined that they are not listable entities and we are withdrawing our proposed rule to add them to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. Section 4(b)(6) of the Act and implementing regulations at 50 CFR 424.17 provide that the Service must, within 1 year of a proposed rule to list, delist, or reclassify species, or to designate or revise critical habitat, withdraw the proposal if the available evidence does not justify the proposed action.

Through this rulemaking, the list of recurring marine events requiring special local regulations or safety zones would be updated with revisions, additional events, and removal of events that no longer take place in the Fifth Coast Guard District. When these regulations are enforced, certain restrictions are placed on marine traffic in specified areas.

Great Lakes Pilotage Rates-2017 Annual Review,Proposed Rule,Homeland Security Department; Coast Guard,"The Coast Guard proposes to modify its calculations for hourly pilotage rates on the Great Lakes by accounting for the ``weighting factor,'' which is a multiplier that can increase the pilotage costs for larger vessels traversing areas in the Great Lakes by a factor of up to 1.45. While the weighting factor has existed for decades, it has never been included in any of the previous ratemaking calculations. We propose to add steps to our rate-setting methodology to adjust hourly rates downwards by an amount equal to the average weighting factor, so that when the weighting factor is applied, the cost to the shippers and the corresponding revenue generated for the pilot associations will adjust to what was originally intended.

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We propose to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2014-08- 02 for certain Airbus Model A300 B4-600 and A300 B4-600R series airplanes. AD 2014-08-02 requires modifying the profile of stringer run-outs of both wings, including a high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection of the fastener holes for defects, and repairs if necessary. Since we issued AD 2014-08-02, further analysis in the context of widespread fatigue damage (WFD) concluded that a shorter compliance time is necessary to meet specified requirements to address WFD. This proposed AD would retain the actions required by AD 2014-08-02 and would revise the compliance times. We are proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.", 2017-03032,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/13/2017-03032/airworthiness-directives-airbus-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-03-13/pdf/2017-03032.pdf,03/13/2017
