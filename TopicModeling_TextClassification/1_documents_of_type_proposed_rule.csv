The Standard for Determining Joint-Employer Status,Proposed Rule,National Labor Relations Board,"In order to more effectively enforce the National Labor Relations Act (the Act or the NLRA) and to further the purposes of the Act, the National Labor Relations Board (the Board) proposes a regulation establishing the standard for determining whether two employers, as defined in Section 2(2) of the Act, are a joint employer of a group of employees under the NLRA. The Board believes that this rulemaking will foster predictability and consistency regarding determinations of joint-employer status in a variety of business relationships, thereby promoting labor-management stability, one of the principal purposes of the Act. Under the proposed regulation, an employer may be considered a joint employer of a separate employer's employees only if the two employers share or codetermine the employees' essential terms and conditions of employment, such as hiring, firing, discipline, supervision, and direction. More specifically, to be deemed a joint employer under the proposed regulation, an employer must possess and actually exercise substantial direct and immediate control over the essential terms and conditions of employment of another employer's employees in a manner that is not limited and routine.", 2018-19930,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/14/2018-19930/the-standard-for-determining-joint-employer-status,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-09-14/pdf/2018-19930.pdf,09/14/2018

Repeal of Regulation Requiring an Approved New Drug Application for Drugs Sterilized by Irradiation,Proposed Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is proposing to repeal a regulation that requires an FDA-approved new drug application (NDA) or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for any drug product that is sterilized by irradiation (the irradiation regulation). Repealing the irradiation regulation would mean that over- the-counter (OTC) drug products that are generally recognized as safe and effective, that are not misbranded, and that comply with all applicable regulatory requirements can be marketed legally without an NDA or ANDA, even if they are sterilized by irradiation. FDA is proposing to take this action because the irradiation regulation is out of date and unnecessary. The technology of controlled nuclear radiation for sterilization of drugs is now well understood, and our regulations require that OTC drugs be manufactured in compliance with current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs). Appropriate and effective sterilization of drugs, including by irradiation, is adequately addressed by the CGMP requirements.

The Agency is proposing to grant the petition based on an evaluation of waste-specific information provided by Sandvik. This proposed decision, if finalized, conditionally excludes the petitioned waste from the requirements of hazardous waste regulations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We conclude that Sandvik's petitioned waste is nonhazardous with respect to the original federal listing criteria and that there are no other factors (including additional constituents) other than those for which the waste was listed that would warrant retaining the waste as a hazardous waste. Subject to state-only requirements within the state of Washington, or federally-authorized or state-only requirements in other states where the subject wastes may be disposed of, Sandvik's petitioned waste may be disposed of in a Subtitle D landfill which is permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage industrial solid waste.", 2018-19595,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/12/2018-19595/hazardous-waste-management-system-proposed-exclusion-for-identifying-and-listing-hazardous-waste,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-09-12/pdf/2018-19595.pdf,09/12/2018

Magnuson-Stevens Act Provisions; Fisheries Off West Coast States; Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery; Groundfish Bottom Trawl and Midwater Trawl Gear in the Trawl Rationalization Program,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS proposes revising Federal regulations that restrict the use and configuration of bottom and midwater trawl gear for vessels fishing under the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery's Trawl Rationalization Program. The gear restrictions were originally implemented to limit discarding and protect overfished rockfish species. These restrictions are no longer necessary because of changes to the fishery, including implementation of the Trawl Rationalization Program in 2011, and improved status of a number of overfished rockfish stocks. By eliminating these regulations, the proposed action could increase flexibility in how vessels can use and configure gear to increase access to target stocks and efficiency of fishing practices, while still limiting the catch of target and non-target discards to meet the conservation objectives of the Trawl Rationalization Program.", 2018-19343,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/07/2018-19343/magnuson-stevens-act-provisions-fisheries-off-west-coast-states-pacific-coast-groundfish-fishery,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-09-07/pdf/2018-19343.pdf,09/07/2018
"Apprehension, Processing, Care, and Custody of Alien Minors and Unaccompanied Alien Children",Proposed Rule,Homeland Security Department; Health and Human Services Department,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (``the Departments'') propose to amend regulations relating to the apprehension, processing, care, custody, and release of alien juveniles. In 1985, plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit, Flores v. Reno, challenged the policies of the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) relating to the detention, processing, and release of alien juveniles. The parties reached a settlement agreement, referred to as the Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA). The FSA, as modified in 2001, provides that it will terminate forty-five days after publication of final regulations implementing the agreement. The rule would adopt in regulations provisions that parallel the relevant and substantive terms of the FSA, consistent with the HSA and TVPRA, with some modifications discussed further below to reflect intervening statutory and operational changes while still providing similar substantive protections and standards. It therefore would terminate the FSA. The rule would satisfy the basic purpose of the FSA in ensuring that all juveniles in the government's custody are treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability as minors, while doing so in a manner that is workable in light of subsequent changes. The rule would also implement closely related provisions of the HSA and TVPRA. Most prominently, the rule would create an alternative to the existing licensed program requirement for family residential centers, so that ICE may use appropriate facilities to detain family units together during their immigration proceedings, consistent with applicable law.", 2018-19052,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/07/2018-19052/apprehension-processing-care-and-custody-of-alien-minors-and-unaccompanied-alien-children,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-09-07/pdf/2018-19052.pdf,09/07/2018

A new CRA regulatory framework would help regulated financial institutions more effectively serve the convenience and needs of their communities by encouraging more lending, investment, and activity where it is needed most; evaluating CRA activities more consistently; and providing greater clarity regarding CRA-qualifying activities. A transformed or modernized framework also would facilitate more timely evaluations of bank CRA performance, offer greater transparency regarding ratings, promote a consistent interpretation of the CRA, and encourage increased community and economic development in low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas. Revisions of this nature are consistent with the original intent of the CRA: To help meet the credit needs of the communities that banks serve.

Golden Parachute and Indemnification Payments,Proposed Rule,Federal Housing Finance Agency,"The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is proposing to amend its rule on golden parachute payments to better align the rule with areas of FHFA's supervisory concern and reduce administrative and compliance burdens. The current rule requires FHFA review and consent before a regulated entity or the Office of Finance (OF) enters into an agreement to make, or makes, a payment that is contingent on the termination of an affiliated party, if the regulated entity or OF is in a troubled condition, in conservatorship or receivership, or insolvent. FHFA's experience implementing the rule indicates that the rule requires review of some agreements and payments where there is little risk of excess or abuse, and thus that it is too broad. If amended as proposed, the rule would focus on the types of agreements and payments that are of greater supervisory concern to FHFA. In general, these are payments to and agreements with executive officers, broad-based plans covering large numbers of employees (such as severance plans), and payments made to non-executive-officer employees who may have engaged in certain types of wrongdoing. The proposed amendments would also revise and clarify definitions, exemptions, and procedures to implement FHFA's supervisory approach. Where possible, FHFA would also align procedures and outcomes of review under the Golden Parachute Payment Rule with requirements of FHFA's rule on executive compensation.

EPA is also proposing to approve the 2017 transportation conformity motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for the Indiana portion of the Chicago area for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. EPA is proposing to approve the state's submission as a SIP revision pursuant to section 110 and part D of the CAA and EPA's regulations because it satisfies the emission inventory, RFP, RFP contingency measure, nonattainment NSR, VOC RACT, I/M, and transportation conformity requirements for areas classified as moderate nonattainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Final approval of Indiana's SIP as meeting the nonattainment NSR requirements of the CAA for the 2008 ozone NAAQS will permanently stop the sanctions and Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clocks triggered by EPA's February 3, 2017 finding that Indiana failed to submit a marginal ozone nonattainment NSR plan.", 2018-18640,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/08/28/2018-18640/air-plan-approval-indiana-reasonable-further-progress-plan-and-other-plan-elements-for-the-chicago,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-08-28/pdf/2018-18640.pdf,08/28/2018
Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; West Virginia; Revisions to Regulation for Control of Ozone Season Nitrogen Oxide Emissions,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve two state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of West Virginia. The revisions pertain to a West Virginia regulation that established the nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) ozone season trading program under the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which implemented requirements for NO<INF>X</INF> reductions necessary to reduce interstate transport of pollution. The EPA-administered trading programs under CAIR were discontinued upon the implementation of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), which was promulgated by EPA to replace CAIR. CSAPR established federal implementation plans (FIPs) for 28 states, including West Virginia, and applied to electric generating units (EGUs) as defined. The SIP submittals are comprised of revisions to the West Virginia regulation that implemented the CAIR ozone season NO<INF>X</INF> trading program and that had previously been included in the West Virginia SIP. The revised West Virginia regulation removed the CAIR ozone season NO<INF>X</INF> trading program provisions, which also addressed certain large non-electric generating units (non-EGUs), established new requirements for these large non- EGUs, included a state-wide NO<INF>X</INF> emissions cap, and recodified certain other provisions that address the NO<INF>X</INF> emission reductions required for cement kilns and internal combustion engines. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA).", 2018-18524,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/08/28/2018-18524/approval-and-promulgation-of-air-quality-implementation-plans-west-virginia-revisions-to-regulation,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-08-28/pdf/2018-18524.pdf,08/28/2018

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Maryland; Regional Haze Five-Year Progress Report,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. Maryland's SIP revision, the Regional Haze Five-Year Progress Report, addresses Clean Air Act (CAA) provisions that require the State to submit periodic reports addressing reasonable progress goals (RPGs) established for regional haze and to make a determination of the adequacy of the State's existing regional haze SIP. Maryland's progress report notes that the State has implemented the measures that are specified in the regional haze SIP which were due to be in place by the date of the progress report. The progress report also notes that visibility in federal Class I areas that may have been affected by emissions from Maryland is improving and that these Class I areas have already met the applicable RPGs for 2018.

The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule for Model Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; Environmental Protection Agency,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are proposing the ``Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule for Model Years 2021- 2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks'' (SAFE Vehicles Rule). The SAFE Vehicles Rule, if finalized, would amend certain existing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks and establish new standards, all covering model years 2021 through 2026. More specifically, NHTSA is proposing new CAFE standards for model years 2022 through 2026 and amending its 2021 model year CAFE standards because they are no longer maximum feasible standards, and EPA is proposing to amend its carbon dioxide emissions standards for model years 2021 through 2025 because they are no longer appropriate and reasonable in addition to establishing new standards for model year 2026. The preferred alternative is to retain the model year 2020 standards (specifically, the footprint target curves for passenger cars and light trucks) for both programs through model year 2026, but comment is sought on a range of alternatives discussed throughout this document. Compared to maintaining the post-2020 standards set forth in 2012, current estimates indicate that the proposed SAFE Vehicles Rule would save over 500 billion dollars in societal costs and reduce highway fatalities by 12,700 lives (over the lifetimes of vehicles through MY 2029). U.S. fuel consumption would increase by about half a million barrels per day (2-3 percent of total daily consumption, according to the Energy Information Administration) and would impact the global climate by 3/1000th of one degree Celsius by 2100, also when compared to the standards set forth in 2012.", 2018-16820,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/08/24/2018-16820/the-safer-affordable-fuel-efficient-safe-vehicles-rule-for-model-years-2021-2026-passenger-cars-and,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-08-24/pdf/2018-16820.pdf,08/24/2018

Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing: Streamlining and Enhancements,Proposed Rule,Housing and Urban Development Department,"This advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) invites public comment on amendments to HUD's affirmatively furthering fair housing (AFFH) regulations. The goal of the regulations is to provide HUD program participants with a specific planning approach to assist them in meeting their statutory obligation to affirmatively further the purposes and policies of the Fair Housing Act. HUD is committed to its mission of achieving fair housing opportunity for all, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability, or familial status. However, HUD's experience over the three years since the newly- specified approach was promulgated demonstrates that it is not fulfilling its purpose to be an efficient means for guiding meaningful action by program participants. Accordingly, HUD has determined that a new approach towards AFFH is required. As HUD begins the process of developing a proposed rule to amend the existing AFFH regulations, it is soliciting public comment on changes that will: Minimize regulatory burden while more effectively aiding program participants to plan for fulfilling their obligation to affirmatively further the purposes and policies of the Fair Housing Act; create a process that is focused primarily on accomplishing positive results, rather than on performing analysis of community characteristics; provide for greater local control and innovation; seek to encourage actions that increase housing choice, including through greater housing supply; and more efficiently utilize HUD resources. HUD is also reviewing comments submitted in response to the withdrawal of the Local Government Assessment Tool and will consider those comments during HUD's consideration of potential changes to the AFFH regulations.", 2018-17671,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/08/16/2018-17671/affirmatively-furthering-fair-housing-streamlining-and-enhancements,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-08-16/pdf/2018-17671.pdf,08/16/2018

Air Plan Approval; Indiana; Cross-State Air Pollution Rule,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state submission concerning the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) that was submitted by Indiana on November 27, 2017 as a revision to the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP). Under CSAPR, large electricity generating units (EGUs) in Indiana are subject to Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) requiring the units to participate in CSAPR's Federal trading program for annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), one of CSAPR's two Federal trading programs for annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), and one of CSAPR's two Federal trading programs for ozone season emissions of NO<INF>X</INF>. This action would approve the State's regulations requiring large Indiana EGUs to participate in new CSAPR state trading programs for annual NO<INF>X</INF>, annual SO<INF>2</INF>, and ozone season NO<INF>X</INF> emissions integrated with the CSAPR Federal trading programs, replacing the corresponding FIP requirements. EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision because the submittal meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) and EPA's regulations for approval of a CSAPR full SIP revision replacing the requirements of a CSAPR FIP. Under the CSAPR regulations, approval of the SIP revision would automatically eliminate Indiana's units' requirements under the corresponding CSAPR FIPs addressing Indiana's interstate transport (or ``good neighbor'') obligations for the 1997 fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS), the 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, the 1997 ozone NAAQS, and the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Like the CSAPR FIP requirements that would be replaced, approval of the SIP revision would fully satisfy Indiana's good neighbor obligations for the 1997 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, the 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, and the 1997 ozone NAAQS and would partially satisfy Indiana's good neighbor obligation for the 2008 ozone NAAQS.", 2018-17357,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/08/14/2018-17357/air-plan-approval-indiana-cross-state-air-pollution-rule,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-08-14/pdf/2018-17357.pdf,08/14/2018
Subsistence Taking of Northern Fur Seals on the Pribilof Islands,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS proposes to modify the subsistence use regulations for the Eastern Pacific stock of northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) in response to a petition from the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island, Tribal Government (ACSPI). The Fur Seal Act (FSA) prohibits all taking of northern fur seals except in accordance with regulations authorizing Alaska Natives who reside on the Pribilof Islands (Pribilovians) to take northern fur seals for subsistence uses in compliance with a number of explicit regulatory restrictions. The proposed rule would simplify the existing regulations and would enable Pribilovians on St. Paul Island to resume traditional cultural practices that are prohibited by existing regulations, with no adverse consequences to northern fur seals at the population level. The proposed rule would streamline and simplify the regulations and otherwise eliminate several duplicative and unnecessary regulations governing St. Paul and St. George Islands.", 2018-17117,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/08/14/2018-17117/subsistence-taking-of-northern-fur-seals-on-the-pribilof-islands,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-08-14/pdf/2018-17117.pdf,08/14/2018

Enterprise Capital Requirements,Proposed Rule,Federal Housing Finance Agency; Housing and Urban Development Department; Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight Office,"The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA or the Agency) is proposing a new regulatory capital framework for the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (collectively, the Enterprises), which includes a new framework for risk-based capital requirements and two alternatives for an updated minimum leverage capital requirement. The risk-based framework would provide a granular assessment of credit risk specific to different mortgage loan categories, as well as market risk, operational risk, and going-concern buffer components. The proposed rule would maintain the statutory definitions of core capital and total capital. FHFA has suspended the Enterprises' capital requirements since the beginning of conservatorship, and FHFA plans to continue this suspension while the Enterprises remain in conservatorship. Despite this suspension, FHFA believes it is appropriate to update the Agency's standards on Enterprise capital requirements to provide transparency to all stakeholders about FHFA's supervisory view on this topic. In addition, while the Enterprises are in conservatorship, FHFA will expect Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to use assumptions about capital described in the rule's risk-based capital requirements in making pricing and other business decisions.

Adjusting Program Fees for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program,Proposed Rule,Homeland Security Department; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to adjust fees charged by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to individuals and organizations.

For most categories of individuals seeking to become exchange (J visa) visitors, DHS proposes to increase the fee from $180 to $220. For those seeking admission as J exchange visitors in the au pair, camp counselor, and summer work or travel program participant categories, DHS proposes to maintain the fee at $35. In addition to raising the student and exchange visitor fees, DHS proposes to increase the fee for submitting a school certification petition from $1,700 to $3,000. DHS proposes to maintain the fee for an initial school site visit at the current level of $655, but clarify that, with the effective date of the rule, DHS would exercise its current regulatory authority to charge the site visit fee not only when a certified school changes its physical location, but also when it adds a new physical location or campus. DHS proposes to establish and clarify two new fees: a $1,250 fee to submit a school recertification petition and a $675 fee to submit an appeal or motion following a denial or withdrawal of a school petition. Adjusting fees would ensure fee levels are sufficient to recover the full cost of activities of the program and would establish a fairer balance of the recovery of SEVP operational costs between beneficiary classes.", 2018-15140,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/07/17/2018-15140/adjusting-program-fees-for-the-student-and-exchange-visitor-program,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-07-17/pdf/2018-15140.pdf,07/17/2018
Yaw Maneuver Conditions-Rudder Reversals,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"The FAA proposes to add a new load condition to the design standards for transport category airplanes. The new load condition would require the airplane be designed to withstand the loads caused by rapid reversals of the rudder pedals and would apply to transport category airplanes that have a powered rudder control surface or surfaces. This rule is necessary because accident and incident data show that pilots sometimes make rudder reversals during flight, even though such reversals are unnecessary and discouraged by flightcrew training programs. The current design standards do not require the airplane structure to withstand the loads that may result from such reversals. If the airplane loads exceed those for which it is designed, the airplane structure may fail, resulting in catastrophic loss of control of the airplane. This proposal aims to prevent structural failure of the rudder and vertical stabilizer that may result from these rudder reversals.", 2018-15154,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/07/16/2018-15154/yaw-maneuver-conditions-rudder-reversals,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-07-16/pdf/2018-15154.pdf,07/16/2018

"Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Pennsylvania; Attainment Plan for the Indiana, Pennsylvania Nonattainment Area for the 2010 Sulfur Dioxide Primary National Ambient Air Quality Standard",Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision, submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), to EPA on October 11, 2017, for the purpose of providing for attainment of the 2010 sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) primary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) in the Indiana, Pennsylvania SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area (hereafter referred to as the ``Indiana Area'' or ``Area''). The Indiana Area is comprised of Indiana County and a portion of Armstrong County (Plumcreek Township, South Bend Township, and Elderton Borough) in Pennsylvania. The major sources of SO<INF>2</INF> in the Indiana Area emitting over 2,000 tpy of SO<INF>2</INF> include several large electric generating units (EGUs): Keystone Plant, Conemaugh Plant, Homer City Generation, and Seward Generation Station (hereafter referred to as ``Keystone,'' ``Conemaugh,'' ``Homer City,'' and ``Seward''). The SIP submission is an attainment plan which includes the base year emissions inventory, an analysis of the reasonably available control technology (RACT) and reasonably available control measure (RACM) requirements, enforceable emission limitations and control measures, a reasonable further progress (RFP) plan, a modeling demonstration of SO<INF>2</INF> attainment, and contingency measures for the Indiana Area. As part of approving the attainment plan, EPA is also proposing to approve into the Pennsylvania SIP SO<INF>2</INF> emission limits and associated compliance parameters for Keystone, Conemaugh, Homer City and Seward and proposes to find Pennsylvania has measures in place to address nonattainment new source review. EPA proposes to approve Pennsylvania's attainment plan and concludes that the Indiana Area will attain the 2010 1-hour primary SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS by the applicable attainment date and that the plan meets all applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act (CAA).", 2018-14947,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/07/13/2018-14947/approval-and-promulgation-of-air-quality-implementation-plans-pennsylvania-attainment-plan-for-the,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-07-13/pdf/2018-14947.pdf,07/13/2018

This rule proposes changes to the Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model to remove two OASIS-based measures, replace three OASIS-based measures with two new proposed composite measures, rescore the maximum number of improvement points, and reweight the measures in the applicable measures set. Also, the Home Health Quality Reporting Program provisions include a discussion of the Meaningful Measures Initiative and propose the removal of seven measures to further the priorities of this initiative. In addition, the HH QRP offers a discussion on social risk factors and an update on implementation efforts for certain provisions of the IMPACT Act.

Determination Regarding Good Neighbor Obligations for the 2008 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The EPA is proposing to determine that the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule Update for the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (CSAPR Update) fully addresses certain states' obligations under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) regarding interstate pollution transport for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. The CSAPR Update, published on October 26, 2016, promulgated Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) for 22 states in the eastern U.S. In the final CSAPR Update, based on information available at that time, the EPA could not conclude that the rule fully addressed CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) obligations for 21 of the 22 CSAPR Update states. This action proposes a determination that, based on additional information and analysis, the CSAPR Update fully addresses this CAA provision for the 2008 ozone NAAQS for all remaining CSAPR Update states. Specifically, EPA proposes to determine that there will be no remaining nonattainment or maintenance receptors in the eastern U.S. in 2023. Therefore, with the CSAPR Update fully implemented, these states are not expected to contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other state with regard to the 2008 ozone NAAQS. In accord with this proposed determination, the EPA proposes to determine that it has no outstanding, unfulfilled obligation under CAA section 110(c)(1) to establish additional requirements for sources in these states to further reduce transported ozone pollution under CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) with regard to the 2008 ozone NAAQS. As a result of this finding, this action proposes minor revisions to the existing CSAPR Update regulations to reflect that the CSAPR Update FIPs fully address CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The proposed determination would apply to states currently subject to CSAPR Update FIPs as well as any states for which EPA has approved replacement of CSAPR Update FIPs with CSAPR Update SIPs.", 2018-14737,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/07/10/2018-14737/determination-regarding-good-neighbor-obligations-for-the-2008-ozone-national-ambient-air-quality,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-07-10/pdf/2018-14737.pdf,07/10/2018

Petitioner also requests modification of WPXQ's license to specify Newport as its community of license pursuant to agency rules. The Petitioner asserts that substantial public interests weigh heavily in favor of reallocating WPXQ to Newport. Newport has a population of 24,027 while Block Island's population consists of approximately 1,000. Petitioner asserts that the proposed reallotment will cause no public harm because Block Island will not only continue to be served by five full-power commercial and one full-power non- commercial television stations, but will also continue to receive the exact same over-the-air service from Petitioner that they are receiving currently. The proposal would result in a preferential allotment by providing Newport with its first local full-power television services in satisfaction of the Commission's second allotment priority, which is also consistent with Commission precedent and consistent with the public interest.", 2018-12657,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/13/2018-12657/television-broadcasting-services-block-island-and-newport-rhode-island,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-06-13/pdf/2018-12657.pdf,06/13/2018
Arbitrage Investment Restrictions on Tax-Exempt Bonds,Proposed Rule,Treasury Department; Internal Revenue Service,This document contains proposed regulations regarding the arbitrage investment restrictions under section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) applicable to tax-exempt bonds and other tax- advantaged bonds issued by State and local governments.

Asbestos; Significant New Use Rule,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), EPA is proposing a significant new use rule (SNUR) for asbestos as defined under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act. The proposed significant new use of asbestos (including as part of an article) is manufacturing (including importing) or processing for certain uses identified by EPA as no longer ongoing. The Agency has found no information indicating that the following uses are ongoing, and therefore, the following uses are subject to this proposed SNUR: Adhesives, sealants, and roof and non-roof coatings; arc chutes; beater-add gaskets; extruded sealant tape and other tape; filler for acetylene cylinders; high-grade electrical paper; millboard; missile liner; pipeline wrap; reinforced plastics; roofing felt; separators in fuel cells and batteries; vinyl-asbestos floor tile; and any other building material (other than cement). Persons subject to the SNUR would be required to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing (including importing) or processing of asbestos (including as part of an article) for a significant new use. The required notification initiates EPA's evaluation of the conditions of use associated with the intended use within the applicable review period.

Publication of the Spring 2018 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions represents a key component of the regulatory planning mechanism prescribed in Executive Order 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735) and Executive Order 13771 (82 FR 93390, January 30, 2017, Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies publish semiannual regulatory agendas in the Federal Register describing regulatory actions they are developing that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (5 U.S.C. 602). In the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda) agencies report regulatory actions upcoming in the next year. Executive Order 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' signed September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51735), and Office of Management and Budget memoranda implementing section 4 of that Order establish minimum standards for agencies' agendas, including specific types of information for each entry.

The complete publication of the spring 2018 Unified Agenda containing the regulatory agendas for 64 Federal agencies, is available to the public at http://reginfo.gov. The Spring 2018 Unified Agenda publication appearing in the Federal Register consists of agency regulatory flexibility agendas, in accordance with the publication requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

"Semiannual Regulatory Agenda, Spring 2018",Proposed Rule,Agriculture Department; Office of the Secretary,"This agenda provides summary descriptions of the significant and not significant regulatory and deregulatory actions being developed in agencies of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in conformance with Executive orders (E.O.) 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' 13563, ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,'' 13771 ``Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs,'' and 13777, ``Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda.'' The agenda also describes regulations affecting small entities as required by section 602 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Public Law 96-354. This agenda also identifies regulatory actions that are being reviewed in compliance with section 610(c) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. We invite public comment on those actions as well as any regulation consistent with Executive Order 13563.

There is no legal significance to the omission of an item from this listing. Also, the dates shown for the steps of each action are estimated and are not commitments to act on or by the date shown. USDA's complete regulatory agenda is available online at www.reginfo.gov. Because publication in the Federal Register is mandated for the regulatory flexibility agendas required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 602), USDA's printed agenda entries include only: (1) Rules that are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (2) Rules identified for periodic review under section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.", 2018-11232,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/11/2018-11232/semiannual-regulatory-agenda-spring-2018,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-06-11/pdf/2018-11232.pdf,06/11/2018

It contains DoD regulations initiated by DoD components that may have economic and environmental impact on State, local, or tribal interests under the criteria of Executive Order 12866.

Fisheries of the Exclusive Economic Zone Off Alaska; Yellowfin Sole Management in the Groundfish Fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 116 to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI FMP). If approved, Amendment 116 would limit access to the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) Trawl Limited Access Sector (TLAS) yellowfin sole directed fishery by vessels that deliver their catch of yellowfin sole to motherships for processing. This proposed rule would establish eligibility criteria based on historical participation in the BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery, issue an endorsement to those groundfish License Limitation Program (LLP) licenses that meet the eligibility criteria, and authorize delivery of BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole to motherships by only those vessels designated on a groundfish LLP license that is endorsed for the BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery. This proposed action is necessary to prevent increased catcher vessel participation from reducing the benefits the fishery provides to historic and recent participants, mitigate the risk that a ``race for fish'' could develop, and help to maintain the consistently low rates of halibut bycatch in the BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery. This proposed rule is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, Amendment 116, the BSAI FMP, and other applicable laws.", 2018-12034,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/06/2018-12034/fisheries-of-the-exclusive-economic-zone-off-alaska-yellowfin-sole-management-in-the-groundfish,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-06-06/pdf/2018-12034.pdf,06/06/2018
Procedures and Standards for Declining Surety Immigration Bonds and Administrative Appeal Requirement for Breaches,Proposed Rule,Homeland Security Department; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes two changes that would apply to surety companies certified by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to underwrite bonds on behalf of the Federal Government. First, the proposed rule would require Treasury-certified sureties seeking to overturn a surety immigration bond breach determination to exhaust administrative remedies by filing an administrative appeal raising all legal and factual defenses. This requirement to exhaust administrative remedies and present all issues to the administrative tribunal would allow Federal district courts to review a written decision addressing all of the surety's defenses, thereby streamlining litigation over the breach determination's validity. Second, this proposed rule would set forth ``for cause'' standards and due process protections so that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a component of DHS, may decline bonds from companies that do not cure their deficient performance. Treasury administers the Federal corporate surety program and, in its current regulations, allows agencies to prescribe in their regulations for cause standards and procedures for declining to accept bonds from a Treasury-certified surety company. DHS proposes the for cause standards contained in this rule because certain surety companies have failed to pay amounts due on administratively final bond breach determinations or have had in the past unacceptably high breach rates.", 2018-11940,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/05/2018-11940/procedures-and-standards-for-declining-surety-immigration-bonds-and-administrative-appeal,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-06-05/pdf/2018-11940.pdf,06/05/2018

Margin Requirements for Uncleared Swaps for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants,Proposed Rule,Commodity Futures Trading Commission,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is seeking comment on proposed amendments to the margin requirements for uncleared swaps for swap dealers (``SD'') and major swap participants (``MSP'') for which there is no prudential regulator (``CFTC Margin Rule''). The Commission is proposing these amendments in light of the rules recently adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board''), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC''), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC'') (collectively, the ``QFC Rules'') that impose restrictions on certain uncleared swaps and uncleared security-based swaps and other financial contracts. Specifically, the Commission proposes to amend the definition of ``eligible master netting agreement'' in the CFTC Margin Rule to ensure that master netting agreements of firms subject to the CFTC Margin Rule are not excluded from the definition of ``eligible master netting agreement'' based solely on such agreements' compliance with the QFC Rules. The Commission also proposes that any legacy uncleared swap (i.e., an uncleared swap entered into before the applicable compliance date of the CFTC Margin Rule) that is not now subject to the margin requirements of the CFTC Margin Rule would not become so subject if it is amended solely to comply with the QFC Rules. These proposed amendments are consistent with proposed amendments that the Board, FDIC, OCC, the Farm Credit Administration (``FCA''), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (``FHFA'' and, together with the Board, FDIC, OCC, and FCA, the ``Prudential Regulators''), jointly published in the Federal Register on February 21, 2018.", 2018-10995,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/05/23/2018-10995/margin-requirements-for-uncleared-swaps-for-swap-dealers-and-major-swap-participants,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-05-23/pdf/2018-10995.pdf,05/23/2018

Specifically, the proposed rule will require applicants to file an online application rather than a paper application, and upload a complete digital copy of each issue through the electronic registration system instead of submitting them in physical form. It will update the eligibility requirements for this group option in several respects, such as clarifying that each issue must be published under the same continuing title. In addition, the proposed rule will remove the requirement that the claimant provide the Library of Congress with two complimentary subscriptions to that serial as a condition for using the group registration option. Under the proposed rule, however, serial publishers will remain subject to the mandatory deposit requirement. Specifically, if a serial is published in the United States in a physical format, the publisher must send complimentary subscriptions to the Library, unless it is informed that the serial title is not needed for the Library's collection. Serials published only in electronic form will continue to be subject to the existing on-demand mandatory deposit regime. The Office invites public comment on these proposed changes.", 2018-10422,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/05/17/2018-10422/group-registration-of-serials,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-05-17/pdf/2018-10422.pdf,05/17/2018
Group Registration of Newsletters,Proposed Rule,"Library of Congress; Copyright Office, Library of Congress","The U.S. Copyright Office is proposing to update its regulation governing the group registration option for newsletters, which are defined in part as a class of serials that are published at least two days each week. The proposed rule would make a number of changes to reflect current Office practices, promote efficiency of the registration process, and encourage broader participation in the registration system by reducing the burden on applicants. Specifically, the proposed rule would require applicants to file an online application, rather than a paper application, and upload a complete digital copy of each issue through the electronic registration system instead of submitting them in physical form. The proposed rule would amend the definition of ``newsletter,'' and eliminate the requirement that each issue must be a work made for hire and the requirement that the applicants submit their claims within a certain period of time. In addition, the proposed rule would remove the requirement that the claimant provide the Library with complimentary subscriptions to or microfilm of the newsletter as a condition for using the group registration option. Under the proposed rule, however, newsletter publishers would remain subject to the mandatory deposit requirement. Specifically, if the newsletter is published in the United States in a physical format, the publisher must provide the Library with two complimentary subscriptions to the newsletter, unless it is informed that the newsletter is not needed for the Library's collections.

Migratory Bird Permits; Regulations for Managing Resident Canada Goose Populations,Proposed Rule,Interior Department; Fish and Wildlife Service,"In 2005, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or ``we'') published a final environmental impact statement on management of resident Canada geese (Branta canadensis) that documented resident Canada goose population levels ``that are increasingly coming into conflict with people and causing personal and public property damage.'' Subsequently, the Service implemented several actions intended to reduce, manage, and control resident Canada goose populations in the continental United States and to reduce related damages; those actions included depredation and control orders that allow destruction of Canada goose nests and eggs by authorized personnel between March 1 and June 30. However, some resident Canada geese currently initiate nests in February, particularly in the southern United States, and it seems likely that in the future nest initiation dates will begin earlier and hatching of eggs will perhaps end later than dates currently experienced. Thus, the Service proposes to amend the depredation and control orders to allow destruction of resident Canada goose nests and eggs at any time of year.", 2018-08500,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/25/2018-08500/migratory-bird-permits-regulations-for-managing-resident-canada-goose-populations,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-04-25/pdf/2018-08500.pdf,04/25/2018

Approval Criteria for Rates Charged for Community Residential Care,Proposed Rule,Veterans Affairs Department,"This document proposes to amend the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regulation governing standards applicable to a community residential care facility (CRC) approved by VA. This regulation also addresses the amount that a veteran may be charged for residence in a CRC and how VA determines whether that rate is appropriate. Payment for the charges of CRC care is not the responsibility of the federal government or VA. The cost of community residential care is financed by the veteran's own resources, and the resident or an authorized personal representative and a representative of the community residential care facility must agree upon the charge and payment procedures for community residential care. VA reviews and has approval authority over this agreement. We propose to amend and update the criteria VA uses to determine whether the rate for care charged to a veteran residing in an approved CRC is appropriate, to clarify how VA determines whether a CRC rate should be approved, and to make the regulation consistent with current VA practice.

Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects: Proposed Six Month Delay of the General Compliance Date While Allowing the Use of Three Burden-Reducing Provisions During the Delay Period,Proposed Rule,Homeland Security Department; Agriculture Department; Energy Department; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Commerce Department; Consumer Product Safety Commission; Social Security Administration; Agency for International Development; Housing and Urban Development Department; Labor Department; Defense Department; Education Department; Veterans Affairs Department; Environmental Protection Agency; Health and Human Services Department; National Science Foundation; Transportation Department,"In a final rule published on January 19, 2017, federal departments and agencies made revisions to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (hereafter the ``2018 Requirements''). The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) adopted the same regulatory changes in a separate final rule published on September 18, 2017. The 2018 Requirements were scheduled to become effective on January 19, 2018, with a general compliance date of January 19, 2018 (with the exception of the revisions to the cooperative research provision). The departments and agencies listed in this document have also published an interim final rule delaying the effective date and general compliance date for the 2018 Requirements for six months, to cover the time period of January 19, 2018 until July 19, 2018. As per the interim final rule, the effective date of the 2018 Requirements is now July 19, 2018. The departments and agencies listed in this document propose delaying the general compliance date for the 2018 Requirements for an additional six months, for the time period of July 19, 2018 until January 21, 2019. This proposed rule is intended to provide additional time to regulated entities for the preparations necessary to implement the 2018 Requirements. This proposed rule, if finalized, would require regulated entities to continue to comply with the requirements of the current Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (hereafter the ``pre-2018 Requirements'') until January 21, 2019. This proposal also takes comment on whether to permit institutions to implement, for certain research studies, the following provisions in the 2018 Requirements during the period from July 19, 2018, until January 21, 2019, that the general compliance date is delayed. Those three provisions, intended to reduce burdens on regulated entities, are the 2018 Requirements' definition of ``research,'' which deems certain activities not to be research, the allowance for no annual continuing review of certain categories of research, and the elimination of the requirement that institutional review boards (IRBs) review grant applications related to the research. The way that this option is proposed, regulated entities would be required to comply with all pre- 2018 Requirements during the period that the general compliance date is delayed, except for provisions substituted by the three burden-reducing provisions of the 2018 Requirements. As described in section III, below, this flexibility is proposed only for studies for which an institution makes a choice to transition to comply with the 2018 Requirements, beginning on July 19, 2018. In order to clearly describe this proposed flexibility, including how it would impact institutions choosing to transition research to comply with the 2018 Requirements, this document proposes a redrafted transition provision.", 2018-08231,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/20/2018-08231/federal-policy-for-the-protection-of-human-subjects-proposed-six-month-delay-of-the-general,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-04-20/pdf/2018-08231.pdf,04/20/2018
"Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio Standards for U.S. Global Systemically Important Bank Holding Companies and Certain of Their Subsidiary Insured Depository Institutions; Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Bank Holding Companies",Proposed Rule,Treasury Department; Comptroller of the Currency; Federal Reserve System,"The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are seeking comment on a proposal that would modify the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards for U.S. top-tier bank holding companies identified as global systemically important bank holding companies, or GSIBs, and certain of their insured depository institution subsidiaries. Specifically, the proposal would modify the current 2 percent leverage buffer, which applies to each GSIB, to equal 50 percent of the firm's GSIB risk-based capital surcharge. The proposal also would require a Board- or OCC-regulated insured depository institution subsidiary of a GSIB to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 3 percent plus 50 percent of the GSIB risk-based surcharge applicable to its top-tier holding company in order to be deemed ``well capitalized'' under the Board's and the OCC's prompt corrective action rules. Consistent with this approach to establishing enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards for insured depository institutions, the OCC is proposing to revise the methodology it uses to identify which national banks and Federal savings associations are subject to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards to ensure that they apply only to those national banks and Federal savings associations that are subsidiaries of a Board-identified GSIB. The Board also is seeking comment on a proposal to make conforming modifications to the GSIB leverage buffer of the Board's total loss- absorbing capacity and long-term debt requirements and other minor amendments to the buffer levels, covered intermediate holding company conformance period, methodology for calculating the covered intermediate holding company long-term debt amount, and external total loss-absorbing capacity risk-weighted buffer.", 2018-08066,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/19/2018-08066/regulatory-capital-rules-regulatory-capital-enhanced-supplementary-leverage-ratio-standards-for-us,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-04-19/pdf/2018-08066.pdf,04/19/2018

Mandatory Deposit of Electronic-Only Books,Proposed Rule,"Library of Congress; Copyright Office, Library of Congress","Section 407 of the Copyright Act requires the mandatory deposit with the Copyright Office (``Office'') of all works published in the United States, within three months of publication, for use by the Library of Congress (``Library''). The Office is allowed to exclude certain classes of works from this requirement. In a 2010 interim rule, the Office codified its longstanding practice of excluding from the mandatory deposit requirements all electronic works that are not otherwise available in a physical format (i.e., ``electronic works published in the United States and available only online.''). The 2010 interim rule created one exception to this general rule for electronic- only serials, which are subject to mandatory deposit, if they are published in the United States and if they are affirmatively demanded by the Office. On May 17, 2016, the Office published a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on potential regulatory changes that would make the interim rule final and would make electronic-only books and sound recordings subject to mandatory deposit requirements by way of the same demand process. Based on the responses to the NOI and input from the Library, the Office proposes revising its regulations to make the interim rule final, and to make electronic-only books published in the United States subject to the mandatory deposit requirements if they are affirmatively demanded by the Office.
