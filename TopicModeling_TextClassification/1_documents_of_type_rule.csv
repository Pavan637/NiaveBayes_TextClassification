Establishing a Performance Standard for Authorizing the Importation and Interstate Movement of Fruits and Vegetables,Rule,Agriculture Department; Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,"We are amending our regulations governing the importation of fruits and vegetables by broadening our existing performance standard to provide for approval of all new fruits and vegetables for importation into the United States using a notice-based process. We are also removing the region- or commodity-specific phytosanitary requirements currently found in these regulations. Likewise, we are making an equivalent revision of the performance standard in our regulations governing the interstate movement of fruits and vegetables from Hawaii and the U.S. territories (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and removing the commodity- specific phytosanitary requirements from those regulations. This action will allow for the approval of requests to authorize the importation or interstate movement of new fruits and vegetables in a manner that enables a more flexible and responsive regulatory approach to evolving pest situations in both the United States and exporting countries. It will not, however, alter the science-based process in which the risk associated with importation or interstate movement of a given fruit or vegetable is evaluated or the manner in which risks associated with the importation or interstate movement of a fruit or vegetable are mitigated.", 2018-19984,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/14/2018-19984/establishing-a-performance-standard-for-authorizing-the-importation-and-interstate-movement-of,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-09-14/pdf/2018-19984.pdf,09/14/2018

Accelerating Wireline and Wireless Broadband Deployment by Removing Barriers to Infrastructure Investment,Rule,Federal Communications Commission,"In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts a new framework for the vast majority of pole attachments governed by federal law by instituting a ``one-touch make- ready'' regime, in which a new attacher may elect to perform all simple work to prepare a pole for new wireline attachments in the communications space. This new framework includes safeguards to promote coordination among parties and ensures that new attachers perform the work safely and reliably. The Commission retains the current multi- party pole attachment process for attachments that are complex or above the communications space of a pole, but makes significant modifications to speed deployment, promote accurate billing, expand the use of self- help for new attachers when attachment deadlines are missed, and reduce the likelihood of coordination failures that lead to unwarranted delays. The Commission also improves its pole attachment rules by codifying and redefining Commission precedent that requires utilities to allow attachers to ``overlash'' existing wires, thus maximizing the usable space on the pole; eliminating outdated disparities between the pole attachment rates that incumbent carriers must pay compared to other similarly-situated cable and telecommunications attachers; and clarifying that the Commission will preempt, on an expedited case-by- case basis, state and local laws that inhibit the rebuilding or restoration of broadband infrastructure after a disaster.", 2018-19547,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/14/2018-19547/accelerating-wireline-and-wireless-broadband-deployment-by-removing-barriers-to-infrastructure,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-09-14/pdf/2018-19547.pdf,09/14/2018

Submissions of Exclusion Requests and Objections to Submitted Requests for Steel and Aluminum,Rule,Commerce Department; Industry and Security Bureau,"On March 8, 2018, President Trump issued Proclamations 9704 and 9705 (referred to henceforth as the ``Proclamations''), imposing duties on imports of aluminum and steel. The Proclamations also authorized the Secretary of Commerce (referred to henceforth as the ``Secretary'') to grant exclusions from the duties if the Secretary determines the steel or aluminum article for which the exclusion is requested is not ``produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality'' or should be excluded ``based upon specific national security considerations.'' On March 19, 2018, the Department issued an interim final rule (referred to henceforth as the ``March 19 rule''), setting forth the requirements a directly affected party located in the United States must satisfy when submitting exclusion requests. The March 19 rule also set forth the requirements that U.S. parties must meet when submitting objections to exclusion requests. The March 19 rule amended the National Security Industrial Base Regulations to add two new supplements. The rule published today by BIS, on behalf of the Secretary, revises the two supplements added by the March 19 rule. The revisions are informed by the comments received in response to the March 19 rule and the U.S. Department of Commerce's (referred to henceforth as ``the Department'') experience with managing the exclusion and objection process. The Department understands the importance of having a transparent, fair and efficient exclusion and objection process. The publication of today's rule should make significant improvements in all three respects, but due to the scope of this new process, BIS is publishing today's rule as an interim final rule with request for comments.", 2018-19662,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/11/2018-19662/submissions-of-exclusion-requests-and-objections-to-submitted-requests-for-steel-and-aluminum,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-09-11/pdf/2018-19662.pdf,09/11/2018

Left unaddressed, floating cabins convert the public waters under TVA's management to private use. The amendments re-define nonnavigable houseboats and floating cabins using one term--``floating cabins''--and prohibit new floating cabins on TVA-managed reservoirs after December 16, 2016. The amendments also include limited mooring standards, limitations on expansions of floating cabins, and requirements for owners to register their floating cabins.

Second, EPA is revising groundwater protection standards (GWPS) for four constituents which do not have an established Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL). Finally, the Agency is extending the deadline by which facilities must cease the placement of waste in CCR units closing for cause in two situations: Where the facility has detected a statistically significant increase above a GWPS from an unlined surface impoundment; and where the unit is unable to comply with the aquifer location restriction. Provisions from the proposed rule that are not addressed in this rule will be addressed in a subsequent action.", 2018-16262,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/07/30/2018-16262/hazardous-and-solid-waste-management-system-disposal-of-coal-combustion-residuals-from-electric,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-07-30/pdf/2018-16262.pdf,07/30/2018

Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program: Expiration of Coverage of Children of Same-Sex Domestic Partners; Federal Flexible Benefits Plan: Pre-Tax Payment of Health Benefits Premiums: Conforming Amendments,Rule,Personnel Management Office,"On October 30, 2013, OPM published final regulations in the Federal Register to expand coverage for children of same-sex domestic partners under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program and the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP). The regulation allowed children of same-sex domestic partners living in states that did not allow same-sex couples to marry to be covered family members under the FEHB and the FEDVIP. Due to a subsequent Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage in all states, OPM published an interim final regulation on December 2, 2016, that created a regulatory exception that only allowed children of same-sex domestic partners living overseas to maintain their FEHB and FEDVIP coverage until September 30, 2018. OPM recognized that there were additional requirements placed on overseas federal employees that did not apply to other civilian employees with duty stations in the United States making it difficult to travel to the United States to marry their same-sex partners. Understanding that we have provided agencies with additional time for compliance given that overseas federal employees may not have been able to marry immediately following the Supreme Court decision, OPM is issuing a final rule removing references to domestic partners and domestic partnerships from the regulations. Based on the Supreme Court decision and the two additional year's lead time for domestic partners overseas to marry, the current language in the CFR is not needed and may be somewhat confusing. There is no change in coverage for children whose same-sex partners are married.", 2018-14938,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/07/12/2018-14938/federal-employees-health-benefits-program-and-federal-employees-dental-and-vision-insurance-program,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-07-12/pdf/2018-14938.pdf,07/12/2018

The October 24, 2017 submission addresses the general Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) conflict of interest requirements applicable to Alabama state boards or agency personnel with respect to the approval of permits or enforcement orders. This submission also specifically addresses requirements for implementation of the following national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS): 1997, 2006, and 2012 Fine Particulate Matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>), 2008 8-hour Ozone, 2008 Lead, 2010 Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>), and 2010 Sulfur Dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>). The CAA requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance and enforcement of each NAAQS promulgated by EPA. Whenever EPA promulgates a new or revised NAAQS, the CAA requires the state to make a new SIP submission establishing that the existing SIP meets the various applicable requirements, or revising the SIP to meet those requirements.

Optional Internet Availability of Investment Company Shareholder Reports,Rule,Securities and Exchange Commission,"The Securities and Exchange Commission is adopting new rule 30e-3 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Subject to conditions, new rule 30e-3 will provide certain registered investment companies with an optional method to satisfy their obligations to transmit shareholder reports by making such reports and other materials accessible at a website address specified in a notice to investors. We are also adopting amendments to rule 498 under the Securities Act of 1933 and our fund registration forms to require that during a certain transition period funds that choose to implement the new delivery method for shareholder reports provide prominent disclosures in prospectuses and certain other shareholder documents that will notify investors of the upcoming change in transmission format for a period of two years. New rule 30e-3 and the amendments to rule 498 and our registration forms address the fact that some investors may wish to receive shareholder reports in paper. As such, the new rule incorporates a set of protections so that investors who prefer to receive reports in paper will continue to receive them in that format. These protections include, among others, a minimum length phase-in period that ends no earlier than December 31, 2020 and notice requirements that must be implemented and followed beginning January 1, 2019, or the date shares are first publicly offered, if a registered investment company would want to use new rule 30e-3 as of January 1, 2021. The rule requires that a paper notice be sent to an investor each time a current shareholder report is accessible online. The notice must include instructions for how an investor can elect--at any time--to receive all future reports in paper, or request to receive particular reports in paper on an ad hoc basis. We are also adopting related amendments to certain other rules and forms. This optional method is intended to modernize the manner in which periodic information is made available to investors, which we believe will improve investors' experience while reducing expenses associated with printing and mailing shareholder reports that are borne by investment companies and ultimately their investors.", 2018-12423,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/22/2018-12423/optional-internet-availability-of-investment-company-shareholder-reports,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-06-22/pdf/2018-12423.pdf,06/22/2018

Definition of “Employer” Under Section 3(5) of ERISA-Association Health Plans,Rule,Labor Department; Employee Benefits Security Administration,"This document contains a final regulation under Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) that establishes additional criteria under ERISA section 3(5) for determining when employers may join together in a group or association of employers that will be treated as the ``employer'' sponsor of a single multiple- employer ``employee welfare benefit plan'' and ``group health plan,'' as those terms are defined in Title I of ERISA. By establishing a more flexible ``commonality of interest'' test for the employer members than the Department of Labor (DOL or Department) had adopted in sub- regulatory interpretive rulings under ERISA section 3(5), and otherwise removing undue restrictions on the establishment and maintenance of Association Health Plans (AHPs) under ERISA, the regulation facilitates the adoption and administration of AHPs and expands access to affordable health coverage, especially for employees of small employers and certain self-employed individuals. At the same time, the regulation continues to distinguish employment-based plans, the focal point of Title I of ERISA, from commercial insurance programs and other service provider arrangements. The final rule also sets out the criteria that would permit, solely for purposes of Title I of ERISA, certain working owners of an incorporated or unincorporated trade or business, including partners in a partnership, without any common law employees, to qualify as employers for purposes of participating in a bona fide group or association of employers sponsoring an AHP and also to be treated as employees with respect to a trade, business or partnership for purposes of being covered by the AHP.

Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects: Six Month Delay of the General Compliance Date of Revisions While Allowing the Use of Three Burden-Reducing Provisions During the Delay Period,Rule,Homeland Security Department; Agriculture Department; Energy Department; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Commerce Department; Consumer Product Safety Commission; Social Security Administration; Agency for International Development; Housing and Urban Development Department; Labor Department; Defense Department; Education Department; Veterans Affairs Department; Environmental Protection Agency; Health and Human Services Department; National Science Foundation; Transportation Department,"In a final rule published on January 19, 2017, a number of federal departments and agencies revised to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (often referred to as the ``Common Rule''), which each department and agency adopted into regulations in its part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) adopted the same changes in a final rule published on September 18, 2017. The revised Common Rule was scheduled to become effective on January 19, 2018, with a general compliance date of the same date. By an interim final rule issued on January 17, 2018 and published in the Federal Register on January 22, 2018, federal departments and agencies delayed the effective date and the general compliance date for the revised Common Rule for a 6-month period, until July 19, 2018. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published an interim final rule adopting the same regulatory changes on January 26, 2018. The revised Common Rule, including technical amendments made by the January 22, 2018 interim final rule, is referred to here as the ``2018 Requirements.'' On April 20, 2018, the federal departments and agencies listed here published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing and seeking comments as to whether the general compliance date for the 2018 Requirements should be delayed for an additional 6-month period. The NPRM also proposed and sought comments on whether to allow regulated entities to implement certain burden-reducing provisions of the 2018 Requirements in specified circumstances during such continued delay period. Through this final rule, we are adopting the proposals described in the April 20, 2018 NPRM. This rule delays the general compliance date for the 2018 Requirements for an additional 6-month period, until January 21, 2019. As a result of this delay, regulated entities will be required, with an exception, to continue to comply with the requirements of the pre-2018 version of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (the ``pre-2018 Requirements'') until January 21, 2019. The one exception to this general rule is that institutions will be permitted (but not required) to implement, for certain research, three burden-reducing provisions of the 2018 Requirements during the delay period (July 19, 2018, through January 20, 2019). Those three provisions are: The revised definition of ``research,'' which deems certain activities not to be research covered by the Common Rule; the elimination of the requirement for annual continuing review with respect to certain categories of research; and the elimination of the requirement that institutional review boards (IRBs) review grant applications or other funding proposals related to the research. Institutions taking advantage of the three-burden reducing provisions must comply with all other pre-2018 Requirements during the delay period. The three burden-reducing provisions of the 2018 Requirements can only be implemented during the delay period with respect to studies initiated prior to January 21, 2019 that will transition to compliance with the revised Common Rule. Any study that implements these three burden-reducing provisions during the delay period must, beginning on January 21, 2019, comply with all of the 2018 Requirements for the balance of the study's duration.", 2018-13187,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/19/2018-13187/federal-policy-for-the-protection-of-human-subjects-six-month-delay-of-the-general-compliance-date,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-06-19/pdf/2018-13187.pdf,06/19/2018

Thresholds for De Minimis Activity and Exemptions From Licensing Under the Animal Welfare Act,Rule,Agriculture Department; Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,"We are amending the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations to implement amendments to the Act that broadened the scope of the exemptions from the licensing requirements for dealers and exhibitors. Specifically, we are broadening the licensing exemption for any person who maintains four or fewer breeding female dogs, cats, and/or small exotic or wild mammals and only sells the offspring of these animals for pets or exhibition to include additional types of pet animals and domesticated farm-type animals. In addition, we are adding a new licensing exemption for any person who maintains eight or fewer pet animals, small exotic or wild animals, and/or domesticated farm-type animals for exhibition. These actions will allow the Agency to focus its limited resources on situations that pose a higher risk to animal welfare and public safety.
