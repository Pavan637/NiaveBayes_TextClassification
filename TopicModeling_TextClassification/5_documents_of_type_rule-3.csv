Labeling Relief; Formaldehyde Emission Standards for Composite Wood Products,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"EPA is taking direct final action to amend a final rule that published in the Federal Register on December 12, 2016 concerning formaldehyde emission standards for composite wood products. The amendment will allow compliant composite wood products and finished goods that contain compliant composite wood products that were manufactured prior to December 12, 2017 to be labeled as Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Title VI compliant. This means that regulated composite wood products and finished goods that meet the required formaldehyde emissions standards could be voluntarily labeled as compliant as soon as compliance can be achieved. This will enhance regulatory flexibility and facilitate a smoother supply chain transition to compliance with the rule's broader requirements, as well as promote lower formaldehyde emitting products entering commerce earlier than under the rule as originally published. EPA believes that the amendment is non-controversial and does not expect to receive any adverse comments. However, in addition to this direct final rulemaking, elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, EPA is promulgating the amendment as a notice of proposed rulemaking that will be used in the event of adverse comment on the amendments within this direct final action.", 2017-14513,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/07/11/2017-14513/labeling-relief-formaldehyde-emission-standards-for-composite-wood-products,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-07-11/pdf/2017-14513.pdf,07/11/2017

Fisheries Off West Coast States; Coastal Pelagic Species Fisheries; Annual Specifications,Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS issues this rule to implement annual management measures and harvest specifications to establish the allowable catch levels (i.e., annual catch limit (ACL)/harvest guideline (HG)) for the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (hereafter, Pacific sardine), in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the Pacific coast for the fishing season of July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018. These specifications were determined according to the Coastal Pelagic Species (CPS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP). This action includes a prohibition on directed non-tribal Pacific sardine commercial fishing off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, which is required because the estimated 2017 biomass of Pacific sardine has dropped below the biomass threshold specified in the HG control rule. Under this action, Pacific sardine may still be harvested as part of either the live bait or tribal fishery, or as incidental catch in other fisheries; the incidental harvest of Pacific sardine would initially be limited to 40- percent by weight of all fish per trip when caught with other CPS or up to 2 metric tons (mt) when caught with non-CPS. The ACL for the 2017- 2018 Pacific sardine fishing year is 8,000 mt.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Removing the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem Population of Grizzly Bears From the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife,Rule,Interior Department; Fish and Wildlife Service,"The best available scientific and commercial data indicate that the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) population of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) is a valid distinct population segment (DPS) and that this DPS has recovered and no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, as amended (Act). Therefore, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), hereby revise the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife, under the authority of the Act, by establishing a DPS and removing the GYE grizzly bear DPS. The Service has determined that the GYE grizzly bear population has increased in size and more than tripled its occupied range since being listed as threatened under the Act in 1975 and that threats to the population are sufficiently minimized. The participating States of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming and Federal agencies have adopted the necessary post-delisting plans and regulations, which adequately ensure that the GYE population of grizzly bears remains recovered. Concurrent to this final rule, we are appending the Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan Supplement: Revised Demographic Criteria to the 1993 Recovery Plan. Moreover, prior to publication of this final rule, the Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee finalized the 2016 Conservation Strategy that will guide post-delisting monitoring and management of the grizzly bear in the GYE. Additionally, the U.S. Forest Service finalized in 2006 the Forest Plan Amendment for Grizzly Bear Conservation for the GYE National Forests and made a decision to incorporate this Amendment into the affected National Forests' Land Management Plans. Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park appended the habitat standards to their Park Superintendent's Compendia, thereby ensuring that these national parks would manage habitat in accordance with the habitat standards. The States of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming have signed a Tri-State Memorandum of Agreement and enacted regulatory mechanisms to ensure that State management of mortality limits is consistent with the demographic recovery criteria.", 2017-13160,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/06/30/2017-13160/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-removing-the-greater-yellowstone-ecosystem-population,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-06-30/pdf/2017-13160.pdf,06/30/2017

"Air Plan Approval; Washington: General Regulations for Air Pollution Sources, Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council",Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving updates to the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC) air quality regulations in the Washington State Implementation Plan (SIP). The EFSEC regulations primarily adopt by reference the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) general air quality regulations, which the EPA approved in the fall of 2014 and spring of 2015. Consistent with our approval of the Ecology general air quality regulations, we are also approving revisions to EFSEC's air quality regulations to implement the preconstruction permitting regulations for large industrial (major source) energy facilities in attainment and unclassifiable areas, called the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program. The PSD program for major energy facilities under EFSEC's jurisdiction has historically been operated under a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP), in cooperation with the EPA and Ecology. This final approval of the EFSEC PSD program transfers the authority for issuing PSD permits from EPA to EFSEC for all of the categories of energy facilities for which EFSEC has jurisdiction. This narrows the current FIP to cover only those energy facilities for which EFSEC does not have jurisdiction or authority. The EPA is also approving EFSEC's visibility protection permitting program which overlaps significantly with the PSD program in most cases.", 2017-10908,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/05/30/2017-10908/air-plan-approval-washington-general-regulations-for-air-pollution-sources-energy-facility-site,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-05-30/pdf/2017-10908.pdf,05/30/2017

When the EPA designated the majority of areas in the country in December 2014, and March 2015, the EPA deferred initial area designations for several locations, including all of the state of Tennessee except three counties in the Chattanooga area, because the EPA could not determine using available data whether the areas were meeting or not meeting the NAAQS. However, we believed that forthcoming data in 2015 would allow the EPA to make that determination. Tennessee has now submitted complete, quality-assured, and certified air quality monitoring data for 2015 for the areas identified in this document, and based on these data, the EPA is designating these areas as unclassifiable/attainment for the 2012 primary annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS.", 2017-10245,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/05/19/2017-10245/air-quality-designations-for-the-2012-primary-annual-fine-particle-pm25,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-05-19/pdf/2017-10245.pdf,05/19/2017

Air Plan Approval; Rhode Island; Repeal of NOX,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Rhode Island. This revision removes Air Pollution Control (APC) Regulation 41, entitled ``NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Program'' (Rhode Island NBP) from the Rhode Island SIP. The Rhode Island NBP was a market-based cap and trade program, which was created to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) from power plants and other large combustion sources in response to EPA's 1998 NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call. By 2009, EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) had effectively replaced NO<INF>X</INF> Budget Trading Programs in eastern states. CAIR has since been replaced by the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), which was first implemented on January 1, 2015. Rhode Island was not covered by CAIR or CSAPR. The State's NBP was repealed under state law effective July 29, 2014. The five sources meeting the Rhode Island NBP applicability criteria have Title V permits, which contain SIP-derived NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limits, that limit their NO<INF>X</INF> emissions below the maximum emissions (936 tons) that were allowed under the Rhode Island NBP and, therefore, the requirements of the NO<INF>X</INF> SIP Call are satisfied by the emissions limits contained in those sources' permits.

Fisheries Off West Coast States; West Coast Salmon Fisheries; 2017 Management Measures and a Temporary Rule,Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"Through this final rule, NMFS establishes fishery management measures for the 2017 ocean salmon fisheries off Washington, Oregon, and California and the 2018 salmon seasons opening earlier than May 1, 2018. The temporary rule for emergency action (emergency rule), under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), implements the 2017 annual management measures for the West Coast ocean salmon fisheries for the area from the U.S./Canada border to Cape Falcon, OR, from May 1, 2017, through October 28, 2018. The emergency rule is required because allocation of coho harvest between recreational and commercial fisheries will not be consistent with the allocation schedule specified in the Pacific Coast Salmon Fishery Management Plan (FMP) in order to limit fishery impacts on Queets coho and meet conservation and management objectives. The fishery management measures for the area from Cape Falcon, OR, to the U.S./Mexico border are consistent with the FMP and are implemented through a final rule. Specific fishery management measures vary by fishery and by area. The measures establish fishing areas, seasons, quotas, legal gear, recreational fishing days and catch limits, possession and landing restrictions, and minimum lengths for salmon taken in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (3-200 NM) off Washington, Oregon, and California. The management measures are intended to prevent overfishing and to apportion the ocean harvest equitably among treaty Indian, non- treaty commercial, and recreational fisheries. The measures are also intended to allow a portion of the salmon runs to escape the ocean fisheries in order to provide for spawning escapement and inside fisheries (fisheries occurring in state internal waters).", 2017-08638,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/04/28/2017-08638/fisheries-off-west-coast-states-west-coast-salmon-fisheries-2017-management-measures-and-a-temporary,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-04-28/pdf/2017-08638.pdf,04/28/2017

"Cellular Service, Including Changes in Licensing of Unserved Area",Rule,Federal Communications Commission,"In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts revised rules governing the 800 MHz Cellular Radiotelephone (Cellular) Service. The Commission revises the outdated Cellular radiated power rules and related technical provisions, most notably allowing licensees the option to comply with power spectral density (PSD) power limits, while also safeguarding systems that share the 800 MHz band, especially public safety systems, from increased unacceptable interference. These updated rules will allow Cellular licensees to deploy advanced mobile broadband services such as long term evolution (LTE) more efficiently. The Cellular licensing rule revisions continue the transition to a geographic-based regime by eliminating certain filing requirements, and also eliminate the comparative hearing process for Cellular license renewals. Both the technical and licensing reforms provide Cellular licensees with more flexibility, reduce administrative burdens, and enable Cellular licensees to respond more quickly--and at lower cost--to changing market conditions and consumer demand.
