This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as a need to incorporate new revisions into the Limitations section, Chapter 9, of the FAA-approved maintenance program (e.g., maintenance manual) to impose new or more restrictive life limits on critical components.

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Automatic Emergency Braking,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,"This document denies a January 13, 2016 rulemaking petition jointly submitted by Consumer Watchdog, Center for Auto Safety, and Public Citizen. The petition requested NHTSA to begin a rulemaking proceeding to mandate that all light vehicles be equipped with three types of automatic emergency braking (AEB) technologies: Forward crash warning, crash imminent braking, and dynamic brake support. NHTSA is denying the petition because the Agency has already taken significant steps to incentivize the installation of these technologies in a way that allows for continued innovation and technological advancement. First, NHTSA has expanded its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) so that the NCAP information for a vehicle notes whether the vehicle is equipped with one or more of these technologies. Second, it has sought public comment on its plans to revise NCAP so that the presence and level of performance of these technologies affects the overall rating of light motor vehicles. To reinforce these improvements to the NCAP program, NHTSA encouraged and facilitated a process that resulted in 20 light vehicle manufacturers, representing more than 99 percent of light motor vehicle sales in the United States, committing to voluntarily installing forward crash warning and crash imminent braking. While NHTSA's actions will help create availability and market push for AEB technologies, private sector organizations such as the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and Consumer Reports are helping to create market pull through a variety of outreach activities that are helping consumers understand the benefits of AEB as well as differences among various vehicle models. Together with NCAP, the industry commitment and the actions of other stakeholders will lead to the installation of a growing array of AEB technologies in substantially all light vehicles and will foster innovation and competition in this technologically dynamic area. As the manufacturers respond to NCAP and carry out their commitments, the Agency is continuously monitoring their efforts to assess whether additional steps, including the possibility of a rulemaking to establish a new standard, might be needed in the future to ensure realization of the potential benefits from the full array of automatic emergency braking technologies.", 2017-01542,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/25/2017-01542/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards-automatic-emergency-braking,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-25/pdf/2017-01542.pdf,01/25/2017

Marine Casualty Reporting Property Damage Thresholds,Proposed Rule,Homeland Security Department; Coast Guard,"The Coast Guard proposes to amend the monetary property damage threshold amounts for reporting a marine casualty, and for reporting a type of marine casualty called a ``serious marine incident'' (SMI). The initial regulations setting these dollar threshold amounts were promulgated in the early1980s and they have not been updated. Because the monetary thresholds for reporting have not kept pace with inflation, relatively minor casualties must be reported. Additionally, the regulations require mandatory drug and alcohol testing following an SMI; consequently, testing is being conducted for casualties that are less significant than those intended to be captured by the original regulations. Updating the regulations will reduce the burden on vessel owners and operators, and will also reduce the amount of Coast Guard resources expended to investigate these incidents.", 2017-01323,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/23/2017-01323/marine-casualty-reporting-property-damage-thresholds,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-23/pdf/2017-01323.pdf,01/23/2017

"Air Plan Approval; Washington: General Regulations for Air Pollution Sources, Southwest Clean Air Agency Jurisdiction",Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Washington State Implementation Plan (SIP) that were submitted by the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) in coordination with Southwest Clean Air Agency (SWCAA) on December 20, 2016. In the fall of 2014 and spring of 2015, the EPA approved numerous revisions to Ecology's general air quality regulations. However, our approval of the updated Ecology regulations applied only to geographic areas where Ecology, and not a local air agency, has jurisdiction, and statewide to source categories over which Ecology has sole jurisdiction. Under the Washington Clean Air Act, local clean air agencies may adopt equally stringent or more stringent requirements in lieu of Ecology's general air quality regulations, if they so choose. Therefore, the EPA stated that we would evaluate the general air quality regulations as they apply to local jurisdictions in separate, future actions. If finalized, this proposed action would approve the submitted SWCAA general air quality regulations to replace or supplement the corresponding Ecology regulations for sources in SWCAA's jurisdiction, including implementation of the minor new source review and nonattainment new source review permitting programs. This action would also approve a limited subset of Ecology regulations, for which there are no corresponding SWCAA corollaries, to apply in SWCAA's jurisdiction.", 2017-01090,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01090/air-plan-approval-washington-general-regulations-for-air-pollution-sources-southwest-clean-air,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/pdf/2017-01090.pdf,01/19/2017

Proposed Best Interest Contract Exemption for Insurance Intermediaries,Proposed Rule,Labor Department; Employee Benefits Security Administration,"This document contains a notice of pendency before the Department of Labor of a proposed class exemption from certain prohibited transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The provisions at issue generally prohibit fiduciaries with respect to employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) from engaging in self-dealing and receiving compensation from third parties in connection with transactions involving the plans and IRAs. The exemption proposed in this document, if granted, would allow certain insurance intermediaries, and the insurance agents and insurance companies they contract with, to receive compensation in connection with fixed annuity transactions that may otherwise give rise to prohibited transactions as a result of the provision of investment advice to plan participants and beneficiaries, IRA owners and certain plan fiduciaries (including small plan sponsors). The proposed exemption includes protective conditions to safeguard the interests of the plans, participants and beneficiaries and IRA owners and is similar to the Department's Best Interest Contract Exemption (PTE 2016-01) granted on April 8, 2016, at 81 FR 21002, as corrected at 81 FR 44773 (July 11, 2016).", 2017-01316,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01316/proposed-best-interest-contract-exemption-for-insurance-intermediaries,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/pdf/2017-01316.pdf,01/19/2017
Health and Environmental Protection Standards for Uranium and Thorium Mill Tailings,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing new health and environmental protection standards under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) of 1978. The standards proposed in this action would be applicable to byproduct materials produced by uranium in-situ recovery (ISR) and would be implemented by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and NRC Agreement States. The EPA initially proposed new health and environmental protection standards for ISR facilities on January 26, 2015; however, the EPA has decided to re-propose the rule and seek additional public to comment on changes to the original proposal, including changes in the regulatory framework and approach, based on public comment and new information received from stakeholders. The first standards for uranium recovery were issued by the EPA in 1983 when conventional mining and milling were the predominant methods of uranium extraction, and were last amended in 1995. Since the early 1990s, ISR has mostly replaced conventional milling. This proposed rule would strengthen the existing regulations for uranium recovery by adopting new standards addressing groundwater hazards specific to ISR facilities. As with the original proposal, the primary focus of this proposal is groundwater protection, restoration and long-term stability. The most significant changes from the original proposal include: Removing the default 30-year long-term monitoring provision and shifting to a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C corrective action framework as a model rather than a RCRA Subtitle C landfill framework; adding specific criteria and procedures for approving termination of long-term stability monitoring; deleting gross alpha particle activity from proposed Table 1 to subpart F of 40 CFR part 192, and allowing more flexibility for the NRC or Agreement States to determine on a site-specific basis the constituents for which concentration based standards are set. The EPA has also sought to clarify how these standards under UMTRCA complement, and do not overlap with, the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). This action also proposes amendments to certain provisions of the existing rule to address a ruling of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, to update a cross-reference to another environmental standard and to correct certain technical and typographical errors. The proposed rule has been informed by input from the NRC, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), states, tribes, industry, environmental groups and other stakeholders, and would promote public health and protect groundwater by reducing the potential for groundwater contamination after production has ceased, and in aquifers adjacent to ISR facilities during uranium recovery.", 2017-00573,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-00573/health-and-environmental-protection-standards-for-uranium-and-thorium-mill-tailings,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/pdf/2017-00573.pdf,01/19/2017
Trichloroethylene (TCE); Regulation of Use in Vapor Degreasing Under TSCA Section 6(a),Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a volatile organic compound widely used in industrial and commercial processes and has some limited uses in consumer and commercial products. EPA identified significant health risks associated with TCE use in vapor degreasing and EPA's proposed determination is that these risks are unreasonable risks. To address these unreasonable risks, EPA is proposing under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to prohibit the manufacture (including import), processing, and distribution in commerce of TCE for use in vapor degreasing; to prohibit commercial use of TCE in vapor degreasing; to require manufacturers, processors, and distributors, except for retailers of TCE for any use, to provide downstream notification of these prohibitions throughout the supply chain; and to require limited recordkeeping.", 2017-01229,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01229/trichloroethylene-tce-regulation-of-use-in-vapor-degreasing-under-tsca-section-6a,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/pdf/2017-01229.pdf,01/19/2017
Methylene Chloride and N-Methylpyrrolidone; Regulation of Certain Uses Under TSCA Section 6(a),Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"Methylene chloride, also called dichloromethane, is a volatile chemical that has a variety of uses, including paint and coating removal. N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) is a solvent used in a variety of applications, including paint and coating removal. For each of these chemicals, EPA has identified risks of concern associated with their use in paint and coating removal. EPA proposes a determination that these are unreasonable risks. EPA is proposing to prohibit the manufacture (including import), processing, and distribution in commerce of methylene chloride for consumer and most types of commercial paint and coating removal under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). EPA is also proposing to prohibit the use of methylene chloride in these commercial uses; to require manufacturers (including importers), processors, and distributors, except for retailers, of methylene chloride for any use to provide downstream notification of these prohibitions throughout the supply chain; and to require recordkeeping. EPA is proposing an initial ten- year time-limited exemption from these proposed regulations on methylene chloride for coating removal uses critical for national security. First, EPA is proposing to prohibit the manufacture (including import), processing, and distribution in commerce of NMP for all consumer and commercial paint and coating removal; to prohibit the use of NMP for all commercial paint and coating removal; to require, consistent with methylene chloride restrictions, downstream notification of these prohibitions throughout the supply chain; to require recordkeeping; and to provide a time-limited exemption from these proposed regulations on NMP for coating removal uses critical for national security. For NMP, as an alternate proposal, EPA is proposing that (1) commercial users of NMP for paint and coating removal establish a worker protection program for dermal and respiratory protection and not use paint and coating removal products that contain greater than 35 percent NMP by weight (except for product formulations destined to be used by DoD or its contractors performing work only for DOD projects); and (2) processors of products containing NMP for paint and coating removal reformulate products such that these products do not exceed a maximum of 35 percent NMP by weight, identify gloves that provide effective protection for the formulation, and provide warning and instruction labels on the products.", 2017-01222,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01222/methylene-chloride-and-n-methylpyrrolidone-regulation-of-certain-uses-under-tsca-section-6a,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/pdf/2017-01222.pdf,01/19/2017
Transparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Office of the Secretary,"This SNPRM proposes to require air carriers, foreign air carriers, and ticket agents to clearly disclose to consumers at all points of sale customer-specific fee information, or itinerary-specific information if a customer elects not to provide customer-specific information, for a first checked bag, a second checked bag, and one carry-on bag wherever fare and schedule information is provided to consumers. This SNPRM further proposes to require each covered carrier to provide useable, current, and accurate (but not transactable) baggage fee information to all ticket agents that receive and distribute the carrier's fare and schedule information, including Global Distribution Systems and metasearch entities. On covered carrier and ticket agent Web sites, the SNPRM would require the baggage fee information to be disclosed at the first point in a search process where a fare is listed in connection with a specific flight itinerary, adjacent to the fare. The SNPRM would permit carriers and ticket agents to allow customers to opt-out of receiving the baggage fee information when using their Web sites.", 2017-00904,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-00904/transparency-of-airline-ancillary-service-fees,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-19/pdf/2017-00904.pdf,01/19/2017
Procedures for Chemical Risk Evaluation Under the Amended Toxic Substances Control Act,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"As required under section 6(b)(4) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), EPA is proposing to establish a process for conducting risk evaluations to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other non-risk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation, under the conditions of use. Risk evaluation is the second step, after Prioritization, in a new process of existing chemical substance review and management established under recent amendments to TSCA. This proposed rule identifies the steps of a risk evaluation process including scope, hazard assessment, exposure assessment, risk characterization, and finally a risk determination. EPA is proposing that this process be used for the first ten chemical substances to be evaluated from the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments, chemical substances designated as High- Priority Substances during the prioritization process, and those chemical substances for which EPA has initiated a risk evaluation in response to manufacturer requests.

Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records,Proposed Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Office of the Secretary,"On Feb. 9, 2016, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed policy changes to update and modernize the Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records (42 CFR part 2). SAMHSA explained in the NPRM that these changes were intended to better align the regulations with advances in the U.S. health care delivery system while retaining important privacy protections for individuals seeking treatment for substance use disorders. The last substantive update to these regulations was in 1987. SAMHSA is issuing this Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) to propose additional clarifications to the part 2 regulations as amended by the concurrently issued final rule. As noted in the final rule, 42 CFR part 2 Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records, questions raised by commenters highlighted varying interpretations of the 1987 rule's restrictions on lawful holders and their contractors and subcontractors' use and disclosure of part 2-covered data for purposes of carrying out payment, health care operations, and other health care related activities. In consideration of this feedback and given the critical role that third-party payers, other lawful holders, and their contractors, subcontractors, and legal representatives play in the provision of health care services, SAMHSA is issuing this SNPRM to seek further comments on our proposals to address and help clarify these matters before establishing any appropriate restrictions on disclosures to contractors, subcontractors and legal representatives.", 2017-00742,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/18/2017-00742/confidentiality-of-substance-use-disorder-patient-records,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-18/pdf/2017-00742.pdf,01/18/2017

"Organic Research, Promotion, and Information Order",Proposed Rule,Agriculture Department; Agricultural Marketing Service,"This rulemaking proposes the establishment of an industry- funded promotion, research, and information program for certified organic products. The purpose of the program would be to strengthen the position of certified organic products in the marketplace, support research to benefit the organic industry, and improve access to information and data across the organic sector. The proposed program, the Organic Research, Promotion, and Information Order (proposed Order), was submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) by the Organic Trade Association (OTA). Under the proposed Order, certified producers (producers) and certified handlers (handlers) with gross sales in excess of $250,000 for the previous marketing year of certified organic agricultural commodities would pay an assessment of one-tenth of one percent of net organic sales. Importers importing greater than $250,000 in transaction value of organic products for the previous marketing year would pay an assessment of one-tenth of one percent of the transaction value of certified organic products reported to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (Customs or CBP). Producers, handlers, and importers that fall below these thresholds could choose to pay assessments into the program as a ``voluntarily assessed'' entity. The proposed program would be implemented under the Commodity Promotion, Research, and Information Act of 1996 (the Act) and would be administered by a board of assessment payers and one public member appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary). An initial referendum would be held among mandatorily and voluntarily assessed entities (i.e. domestic producers, handlers, and importers) to determine whether they favor implementation of the program prior to it going into effect. This proposed rule also announces the Agricultural Marketing Service's (AMS) intent to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of new information collection requirements to implement the program.", 2017-00601,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/18/2017-00601/organic-research-promotion-and-information-order,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-18/pdf/2017-00601.pdf,01/18/2017

"Use of Lead Free Pipes, Fittings, Fixtures, Solder and Flux for Drinking Water",Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to make conforming changes to existing drinking water regulations based on the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act of 2011 (RLDWA) and the Community Fire Safety Act of 2013 (CFSA). Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) prohibits the use and introduction into commerce of certain plumbing products that are not lead free. The RLDWA revised the definition of lead free to lower the allowable maximum lead content from 8.0 percent to a weighted average of 0.25 percent of the wetted surfaces of plumbing products and established a statutory method for calculating lead content. In addition, the RLDWA created exemptions from the lead free requirements for plumbing products that are used exclusively for nonpotable services as well as for other specified products. The CFSA further amended section 1417 to exempt fire hydrants from these requirements. EPA proposes to establish new requirements to assure that individuals purchasing, installing or inspecting potable water systems can identify lead free plumbing materials. Specifically, EPA proposes to establish labeling requirements to differentiate plumbing products that meet the lead free requirements from those that are exempt from the lead free requirements and to require manufacturers to certify compliance with the lead free requirements. These proposed requirements would reduce inadvertent use of non-lead free plumbing products in potable use applications and, consequently, reduce exposure to lead in drinking water and associated adverse health effects.", 2017-00743,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/17/2017-00743/use-of-lead-free-pipes-fittings-fixtures-solder-and-flux-for-drinking-water,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-17/pdf/2017-00743.pdf,01/17/2017

12-Month Finding on a Petition To List Giant and Reef Manta Rays as Threatened or Endangered Under the Endangered Species Act,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"We, NMFS, announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the giant manta ray (Manta birostris) and reef manta ray (Manta alfredi) as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We have completed a comprehensive status review of both species in response to this petition. Based on the best scientific and commercial information available, including the status review report (Miller and Klimovich 2016), and after taking into account efforts being made to protect these species, we have determined that the giant manta ray (M. birostris) is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout a significant portion of its range. Therefore, we propose to list the giant manta ray as a threatened species under the ESA. Any protective regulations determined to be necessary and advisable for the conservation of the proposed threatened giant manta ray under ESA section 4(d) would be proposed in a subsequent Federal Register announcement. Should the proposed listing be finalized, we would also designate critical habitat for the species, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable. We solicit information to assist this proposed listing determination, the development of proposed protective regulations, and designation of critical habitat in the event the proposed threatened listing for the giant manta ray is finalized. Additionally, we have determined that the reef manta ray (M. alfredi) is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range and is not likely to become so within the foreseeable future. Therefore, we find that the reef manta ray does not warrant listing under the ESA at this time.", 2017-00370,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/12/2017-00370/12-month-finding-on-a-petition-to-list-giant-and-reef-manta-rays-as-threatened-or-endangered-under,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-12/pdf/2017-00370.pdf,01/12/2017
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; V2V Communications,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,"This document proposes to establish a new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS), No. 150, to mandate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications for new light vehicles and to standardize the message and format of V2V transmissions. This will create an information environment in which vehicle and device manufacturers can create and implement applications to improve safety, mobility, and the environment. Without a mandate to require and standardize V2V communications, the agency believes that manufacturers will not be able to move forward in an efficient way and that a critical mass of equipped vehicles would take many years to develop, if ever. Implementation of the new standard will enable vehicle manufacturers to develop safety applications that employ V2V communications as an input, two of which are estimated to prevent hundreds of thousands of crashes and prevent over one thousand fatalities annually.", 2016-31059,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/12/2016-31059/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards-v2v-communications,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-12/pdf/2016-31059.pdf,01/12/2017
Establishing a Deductible for FEMA's Public Assistance Program,Proposed Rule,Homeland Security Department; Federal Emergency Management Agency,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is considering implementing a Public Assistance deductible that would condition States' receipt of FEMA reimbursement for the repair and replacement of public infrastructure damaged by a disaster event. The primary intent of the deductible concept is to incentivize greater State resilience to future disasters, thereby reducing future disaster costs nationally. On January 20, 2016, FEMA (the Agency) published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking comment on a Public Assistance deductible concept. The ANPRM provided a general description of the concept that many commenters found insufficient to provide meaningful comment. In an effort to offer the public a more detailed deductible concept upon which to provide additional feedback, the Agency is issuing a supplemental ANPRM (SANPRM) that presents a conceptual deductible program, including a methodology for calculating deductible amounts based on a combination of each State's fiscal capacity and disaster risk, a proposed credit structure to reward States for undertaking resilience-building activities, and a description of how FEMA could consider implementing the program. At this stage of the rulemaking process, the deductible remains only something that FEMA is considering. The policy conceived of in this document is not a proposal. In this document, FEMA is providing what is merely a description of a direction FEMA could take in future rulemaking in an effort to solicit further feedback from the public. After considering the comments it receives, or as a result of other factors, FEMA may expand on or redevelop this concept.", 2017-00467,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/12/2017-00467/establishing-a-deductible-for-femas-public-assistance-program,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-12/pdf/2017-00467.pdf,01/12/2017

EPA expects this proposed rule will, when made final, increase the likelihood that owners and operators will provide funds necessary to address the CERCLA liabilities at their facilities, thus preventing owners or operators from shifting the burden of cleanup to other parties, including the taxpayer. In addition, EPA expects that by adjusting the amount of financial responsibility to account for environmentally safer practices, it would provide an incentive for implementation of sound practices at hardrock mining facilities and thereby decrease the need for future CERCLA actions.", 2016-30047,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/11/2016-30047/financial-responsibility-requirements-under-cercla-108b-for-classes-of-facilities-in-the-hardrock,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-11/pdf/2016-30047.pdf,01/11/2017
"Financial Responsibility Requirements for Facilities in the Chemical, Petroleum and Electric Power Industries",Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"Section 108(b) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) establishes certain regulatory authorities concerning financial responsibility requirements. Specifically, the statutory language addresses the promulgation of regulations that require classes of facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility consistent with the degree and duration of risk associated with the production, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous substances. On January 6, 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) that identified additional classes of facilities within three industry sectors that may warrant the development of financial responsibility requirements under CERCLA section 108(b)--the Chemical Manufacturing industry (NAICS 325), the Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing industry (NAICS 324), and the Electric Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution industry (NAICS 2211). This document formally announces EPA's intention to publish a notice for proposed rulemaking for classes of facilities within the three industries identified in the 2010 ANPRM, as well as gives an overview of some of the comments received on the ANPRM and initial responses to those comments. The announcement in this action is not a determination that requirements are necessary for any or all of the classes of facilities within the three industries, or that EPA will propose such requirements--rather, it is an announcement that EPA intends to move forward with the regulatory process. After that process, EPA will determine whether proposal of requirements for any or all of the classes of facilities within the three industries is necessary.", 2016-30040,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/11/2016-30040/financial-responsibility-requirements-for-facilities-in-the-chemical-petroleum-and-electric-power,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-11/pdf/2016-30040.pdf,01/11/2017
National Primary Drinking Water Regulations; Announcement of the Results of EPA's Review of Existing Drinking Water Standards and Request for Public Comment and/or Information on Related Issues,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct a review every six years of existing national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWRs) and determine which, if any, need to be revised. The purpose of the review, called the Six-Year Review, is to evaluate current information for regulated contaminants to determine if there is new information on health effects, treatment technologies, analytical methods, occurrence and exposure, implementation and/or other factors that provides a health or technical basis to support a regulatory revision that will improve or strengthen public health protection. EPA has completed a detailed review of 76 NPDWRs and at this time has determined that eight NPDWRs are candidates for regulatory revision. The eight NPDWRs are included in the Stage 1 and the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rules, the Surface Water Treatment Rule, the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. EPA requests comments on the eight NPDWRs identified as candidates for revision and will consider comments and data as it proceeds with determining whether further action is needed. In addition, as part of this Six-Year Review, EPA identified 12 other NPDWRs that were or continue to be addressed in recently completed, ongoing or pending regulatory actions. EPA thus excluded those 12 NPDWRs from detailed review. This document is not a final regulatory decision, but rather the initiation of a process that will involve more detailed analyses of factors relevant to deciding whether a rulemaking to revise an NPDWR should be initiated.", 2016-31262,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/11/2016-31262/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations-announcement-of-the-results-of-epas-review-of-existing,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-11/pdf/2016-31262.pdf,01/11/2017

Addition of Natural Gas Processing Facilities to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI),Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"EPA is proposing to add natural gas processing (NGP) facilities (also known as natural gas liquid extraction facilities) to the scope of the industrial sectors covered by the reporting requirements of section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), commonly known as the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA). Adding these facilities would meaningfully increase the information available to the public on releases and other waste management of listed chemicals from the natural gas processing sector and further the purposes of EPCRA section 313. EPA estimates that at least 282 NGP facilities in the U.S. would meet the TRI employee threshold (10 full- time employees or equivalent) and manufacture, process, or otherwise use (threshold activities) at least one TRI-listed chemical in excess of applicable threshold quantities. NGP facilities in the U.S. manufacture, process, or otherwise use more than 21 different TRI- listed chemicals, including n-hexane, hydrogen sulfide, toluene, benzene, xylene, and methanol. EPA expects that TRI reporting by U.S. NGP facilities would provide significant release and waste management data on these chemicals to the public.", 2016-31921,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/06/2016-31921/addition-of-natural-gas-processing-facilities-to-the-toxics-release-inventory-tri,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-06/pdf/2016-31921.pdf,01/06/2017

"Safety Zone; Apra Harbor, Guam",Proposed Rule,Homeland Security Department; Coast Guard,"The Coast Guard proposes to revise the existing safety zones currently in effect at Naval Wharf Kilo in Apra Outer Harbor, Guam, by adding a 500-yard permanent safety zone, hereinafter referred to as Safety Zone D, to provide a buffer between the explosives regularly handled on Naval Wharf Kilo, and the general public and maritime operators. The addition of Safety Zone D would also reduce the frequency of enforcement of Safety Zones A and B. This action also eliminates from the regulation the requirement to post a sign when Safety Zones A or B are being enforced; during such enforcement periods, notification will occur via a slight modification of the displayed visual indicators already codified in the existing regulation as well as via a broadcast notice to mariners. This rulemaking will better meet the needs of the community and reduce the frequency that restrictions must be imposed through the addition of a less restrictive permanent safety zone, thereby enhancing the safe and efficient use of Apra Outer Harbor Channel in the vicinity of Naval Wharf Kilo.

Position Limits for Derivatives,Proposed Rule,Commodity Futures Trading Commission,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is reproposing rules to amend part 150 of the Commission's regulations concerning speculative position limits to conform to the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 (``Dodd-Frank Act'') amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'' or ``Act''). The reproposal would establish speculative position limits for 25 exempt and agricultural commodity futures and option contracts, and physical commodity swaps that are ``economically equivalent'' to such contracts (as such term is used in section 4a(a)(5) of the CEA). In connection with establishing these limits, the Commission is reproposing to update some relevant definitions; revise the exemptions from speculative position limits, including for bona fide hedging; and extend and update reporting requirements for persons claiming exemption from these limits. The Commission is also reproposing appendices to part 150 that would provide guidance on risk management exemptions for commodity derivative contracts in excluded commodities permitted under the revised definition of bona fide hedging position; list core referenced futures contracts and commodities that would be substantially the same as a commodity underlying a core referenced futures contract for purposes of the definition of location basis contract; describe and analyze fourteen fact patterns that would satisfy the reproposed definition of bona fide hedging position; and present the reproposed speculative position limit levels in tabular form. In addition, the Commission proposes to update certain of its rules, guidance and acceptable practices for compliance with Designated Contract Market (``DCM'') core principle 5 and Swap Execution Facility (``SEF'') core principle 6 in respect of exchange-set speculative position limits and position accountability levels. Furthermore, the Commission is reproposing processes for DCMs and SEFs to recognize certain positions in commodity derivative contracts as non-enumerated bona fide hedges or enumerated anticipatory bona fide hedges, as well as to exempt from position limits certain spread positions, in each case subject to Commission review. Separately, the Commission is reproposing to delay for DCMs and SEFs that lack access to sufficient swap position information the requirement to establish and monitor position limits on swaps.", 2016-29483,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/30/2016-29483/position-limits-for-derivatives,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-12-30/pdf/2016-29483.pdf,12/30/2016

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Threatened Listing Determination for the Oceanic Whitetip Shark Under the Endangered Species Act (ESA),Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS has completed a comprehensive status review under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) in response to a petition from Defenders of Wildlife to list the species. Based on the best scientific and commercial information available, including the status review report (Young et al., 2016), and after taking into account efforts being made to protect the species, we have determined that the oceanic whitetip shark warrants listing as a threatened species. We conclude that the oceanic whitetip shark is likely to become endangered throughout all or a significant portion of its range within the foreseeable future. Any protective regulations determined to be necessary and advisable for the conservation of the species under ESA section 4(d) would be proposed in a subsequent Federal Register announcement. Should the proposed listing be finalized, we would also designate critical habitat for the species, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable. We solicit information to assist in this listing determination, the development of proposed protective regulations, and the designation of critical habitat in the event this proposed listing determination is finalized.", 2016-31460,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/29/2016-31460/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-proposed-threatened-listing-determination-for-the,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-12-29/pdf/2016-31460.pdf,12/29/2016

Security Training for Surface Transportation Employees,Proposed Rule,Homeland Security Department; Transportation Security Administration,"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is proposing to require security training for employees of higher-risk freight railroad carriers, public transportation agencies (including rail mass transit and bus systems), passenger railroad carriers, and over-the- road bus (OTRB) companies. Owner/operators of these higher-risk railroads, systems, and companies would be required to train employees performing security-sensitive functions, using a curriculum addressing preparedness and how to observe, assess, and respond to terrorist- related threats and/or incidents. As part of this rulemaking, TSA would also expand its current requirements for rail security coordinators and reporting of significant security concerns (currently limited to freight railroads, passenger railroads, and the rail operations of public transportation systems) to include the bus components of higher- risk public transportation systems and higher-risk OTRB companies. TSA also proposes to make the maritime and land transportation provisions of TSA's regulations consistent with other TSA regulations by codifying general responsibility to comply with security requirements; compliance, inspection, and enforcement; and procedures to request alternate measures for compliance. Finally, TSA is adding a definition for Transportation Security-Sensitive Materials (TSSM). Other provisions are being amended or added, as necessary, to implement these additional requirements.

This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (CAA). In the Final Rules section of this Federal Register, EPA is making this determination of attainment as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial submittal and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this action, no further activity is contemplated. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule.

We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action., 2016-29594,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/09/2016-29594/approval-of-california-air-plan-revisions-imperial-county-air-pollution-control-district,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-12-09/pdf/2016-29594.pdf,12/09/2016
Phosphoric Acid Manufacturing and Phosphate Fertilizer Production Risk and Technology Review,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"This action proposes amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Phosphoric Acid Manufacturing and Phosphate Fertilizer Production source categories. The proposed amendments are in response to two petitions for reconsideration filed by industry stakeholders on the rule revisions to NESHAP for the Phosphoric Acid Manufacturing and Phosphate Fertilizer Production source categories that were promulgated on August 19, 2015 (80 FR 50386) (hereafter the ``August 2015 Final Rule'').

Allocations of Cross-State Air Pollution Rule Allowances From New Unit Set-Asides for 2016 Control Periods,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing notice of the availability of preliminary lists of units eligible for allocations of emission allowances under the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). Under the CSAPR federal implementation plans (FIPs), portions of each covered state's annual emissions budgets for each of the CSAPR emissions trading programs are reserved for allocation to electricity generating units that commenced commercial operation on or after a certain date (new units) and certain other units not otherwise obtaining allowance allocations under the FIPs. The quantities of allowances allocated to eligible units from each new unit set-aside (NUSA) under the FIPs are calculated in an annual one- or two-round allocation process. EPA previously completed the first round of NUSA allowance allocations for the 2016 control periods for all the CSAPR trading programs, as well as the second round of allocations for the CSAPR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program, and is now making available preliminary lists of units eligible for allocations in the second round of the NUSA allocation process for the CSAPR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual, SO<INF>2</INF> Group 1, and SO<INF>2</INF> Group 2 Trading Programs. EPA has posted spreadsheets containing the preliminary lists on EPA's Web site. EPA will consider timely objections to the lists of eligible units contained in the spreadsheets and will promulgate a document responding to any such objections no later than February 15, 2017, the deadline for recording the second- round allocations of CSAPR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual, SO<INF>2</INF> Group 1, and SO<INF>2</INF> Group 2 allowances in sources' compliance accounts.

Privacy Act; Implementation,Proposed Rule,Health and Human Services Department,"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or Department), through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), proposes to exempt, from certain requirements of the Privacy Act, a subset of records in a new system of records, System No. 09-25-0225, NIH Electronic Research Administration (eRA) Records (NIH eRA Records), which covers records used in managing NIH research and development applications and awards throughout the award lifecycle. Elsewhere in today's Federal Register, HHS has published a proposed System of Records Notice (SORN) for System No. 09-25-0225 for public notice and comment. The subset of records proposed to be exempted is material that would inappropriately reveal the identities of referees who provide letters of recommendation and peer reviewers who provide written evaluative input and recommendations to NIH about particular funding applications under an express promise by the government that their identities in association with the written work products they authored and provided to the government will be kept confidential. Only material that would inappropriately reveal a particular referee or peer reviewer as the author of a specific work product (e.g., reference or recommendation letters, reviewer critiques, preliminary or final individual overall impact/priority scores, and/or assignment of peer reviewers to an application and other evaluative materials and data compiled by NIH/OER) is proposed to be exempted. The exemptions would protect not only an author's name in association with their written work product but any content that could enable the author to be identified from context. The Privacy Act provisions from which the material is proposed to be exempted are those that require the agency to provide an accounting of disclosures, access and amendment, and notification, which are contained in subsections (c)(3) and (d) of the Privacy Act.", 2016-29058,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/08/2016-29058/privacy-act-implementation,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-12-08/pdf/2016-29058.pdf,12/08/2016
Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants: Notice of 12-Month Finding on a Petition To List the Gulf of Mexico Bryde's Whale as Endangered Under the Endangered Species Act (ESA),Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"We, NMFS, announce a 12-month finding and listing determination on a petition to list the Gulf of Mexico Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni) as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We have completed a Status Review report of the Gulf of Mexico Bryde's whale in response to a petition submitted by the Natural Resources Defense Council. After reviewing the best scientific and commercial data available, including the Status Review report, and consulting with the Society for Marine Mammology's Committee on Taxonomy, we have determined that the Gulf of Mexico Bryde's whale is taxonomically a subspecies of the Bryde's whale thus meeting the ESA's definition of a species. Based on the Gulf of Mexico Bryde's whale's small population (likely fewer than 100 individuals), its life history characteristics, its extremely limited distribution, and its vulnerability to existing threats, we believe that the species faces a high risk of extinction. Based on these considerations, described in more detail within this action, we conclude that the Gulf of Mexico Bryde's whale is in danger of extinction throughout all of its range and meets the definition of an endangered species. We are soliciting information that may be relevant to inform both our final listing determination and designation of critical habitat.", 2016-29412,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/08/2016-29412/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-notice-of-12-month-finding-on-a-petition-to-list-the,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-12-08/pdf/2016-29412.pdf,12/08/2016

Passenger Equipment Safety Standards; Standards for Alternative Compliance and High-Speed Trainsets,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Railroad Administration,"FRA is proposing to amend its regulations for passenger equipment safety standards, which currently provide for passenger rail service in a shared right-of-way under two separate tiers of safety standards: Tier I (speeds up to 125 miles per hour (mph)) and Tier II (speeds up to 150 mph). Consistent with the regulations' approach supporting interoperable passenger rail service by sharing the right- of-way, this proposed rulemaking would add a new tier of safety standards (Tier III) to facilitate the safe implementation of interoperable high-speed passenger rail service at speeds up to 220 mph. However, Tier III standards would require operations at speeds above 125 mph to be in an exclusive right-of-way without grade crossings. The proposal also would establish crashworthiness and occupant protection performance requirements in the alternative to those currently specified for Tier I passenger trainsets. Adopting the proposed alternative crashworthiness and occupant protection requirements would remove regulatory barriers, allowing a more open U.S. rail market, incorporating recent technological designs.

Regulations Issued Under Authority of the Export Apple Act and Export Grapes and Plums; Changes to Export Reporting Requirements,Proposed Rule,Agriculture Department; Agricultural Marketing Service,"This proposed rule would change the reporting of export certificate information under regulations issued pursuant to the Export Apple Act (7 CFR part 33) and the Export Grape and Plum Act (7 CFR part 35). This change would require shippers of apples and grapes exported from the United States to electronically enter an Export Form Certificate number or a USDA-defined exemption code into the Automated Export System (AES). This rule would also define ``shipper,'' shift the current file retention requirement from carriers to shippers, and require shippers to provide, upon request, copies of the certificates to the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). These changes would enable AMS to track exported apple and grape shipments to ensure that exports meet inspection and certification requirements. This action is also required to support the International Trade Data System (ITDS), a key White House economic initiative that will automate the filing of export and import information by the trade. This proposal would also remove obsolete regulations and make clarifying changes.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Review of Native Species That Are Candidates for Listing as Endangered or Threatened; Annual Notification of Findings on Resubmitted Petitions; Annual Description of Progress on Listing Actions,Proposed Rule,Interior Department; Fish and Wildlife Service,"In this Candidate Notice of Review (CNOR), we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), present an updated list of plant and animal species native to the United States that we regard as candidates for or, have proposed for addition to the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. Identification of candidate species can assist environmental planning efforts by providing advance notice of potential listings, and by allowing landowners and resource managers to alleviate threats and thereby possibly remove the need to list species as endangered or threatened. Even if we subsequently list a candidate species, the early notice provided here could result in more options for species management and recovery by prompting earlier candidate conservation measures to alleviate threats to the species. This CNOR summarizes the status and threats that we evaluated in order to determine whether species qualify as candidates, to assign a listing priority number (LPN) to each candidate species, and to determine whether a species should be removed from candidate status. Additional material that we relied on is available in the Species Assessment and Listing Priority Assignment Forms (species assessment forms) for each candidate species. This CNOR changes the LPN for one candidate. Combined with other decisions for individual species that were published separately from this CNOR in the past year, the current number of species that are candidates for listing is 30. This document also includes our findings on resubmitted petitions and describes our progress in revising the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants (Lists) during the period October 1, 2015, through September 30, 2016.

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,"This document denies a petition for rulemaking, submitted by Ms. Scheryn Bennett, requesting that the National Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) require every vehicle to be equipped with an emergency glass breaking tool. The data available to the agency shows there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the actual number of occupants that may have died due solely to drowning while trapped in an immersed vehicle. The potential effectiveness of such a tool to successfully aid an occupant's safe exit from an immersed vehicle is also not known. In the absence of a requirement that each vehicle have a glass breaking tool, nothing prevents vehicle manufacturers from providing a tool or other means to allow vehicle evacuation during immersion. Additionally, consumers can purchase their own tool and locate it in the vehicle where they would be likely to access it in an emergency.", 2016-28126,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/01/2016-28126/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-12-01/pdf/2016-28126.pdf,12/01/2016

Procedures Further Implementing the Annual Limitation on Suspension of Deportation and Cancellation of Removal,Proposed Rule,Justice Department; Executive Office for Immigration Review,"The Department of Justice proposes to amend the regulations of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) governing the annual statutory limitation on cancellation of removal and suspension of deportation decisions. First, the rule proposes to eliminate certain procedures created in 1998 that were used to convert 8,000 conditional grants of suspension of deportation and cancellation of removal to outright grants before the end of fiscal year 1998. The need for such procedures ceased to exist after the end of fiscal year 1998. Second, the Department proposes to authorize immigration judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) to issue final decisions denying applications, without restriction, regardless of whether the annual limitation has been reached. This proposed amendment would decrease the high volume of reserved decisions that results when the annual limitation is reached early in the fiscal year; reduce the associated delays caused by postponing the resolution of pending cases before EOIR; and provide an applicant with knowledge of a decision in the applicant's case on or around the date of the hearing held on the applicant's suspension or cancellation application.", 2016-28590,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/30/2016-28590/procedures-further-implementing-the-annual-limitation-on-suspension-of-deportation-and-cancellation,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-11-30/pdf/2016-28590.pdf,11/30/2016

Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We propose to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2008-12- 04, which applies to certain Boeing Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, and -900 series airplanes. AD 2008-12-04 currently requires various repetitive inspections to detect cracks along the chem-milled steps of the fuselage skin, and to detect missing or loose fasteners in the area of the preventive modification or repairs, replacement of the time- limited repair with the permanent repair if applicable, and applicable corrective actions, if necessary, which would end certain repetitive inspections. Since we issued AD 2008-12-04, an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) has indicated that the upper skin panel at the chem-milled step above the lap joint is subject to widespread fatigue damage (WFD) if the modification was installed after 30,000 total flight cycles. This proposed AD would reduce the post-modification inspection compliance times, limit installation of the preventive modification to airplanes with fewer than 30,000 total flight cycles, and add repetitive inspections for modified airplanes.

Revisions to Procedure 2-Quality Assurance Requirements for Particulate Matter Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems at Stationary Sources,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing revisions to a procedure in the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS). The procedure provides the ongoing quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures for assessing the acceptability of particulate matter (PM) continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS). The procedure explains the criteria for passing an annual response correlation audit (RCA) and the criteria for passing an annual relative response audit (RRA). The procedure currently contains a requirement that the annual QA/QC test results for affected facilities must fall within the same response range as was used to develop the existing PM CEMS correlation curve. As a result, some facilities are unable to meet the criteria for passing their annual QA/QC test simply because their emissions are now lower than the range previously set during correlation testing. We are proposing to modify the procedure to allow facilities to extend their PM CEMS correlation regression line to the lowest PM CEMS response obtained during the RCA or RRA, when these PM CEMS responses are less than the lowest response used to develop the existing correlation curve. We also propose to correct a typographical error in the procedure.", 2016-27847,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/21/2016-27847/revisions-to-procedure-2-quality-assurance-requirements-for-particulate-matter-continuous-emission,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-11-21/pdf/2016-27847.pdf,11/21/2016

Implementation of the 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone: Nonattainment Area Classifications and State Implementation Plan Requirements,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing nonattainment area classification thresholds and implementation requirements for the strengthened 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) (2015 ozone NAAQS) that were promulgated on October 1, 2015. This proposal is largely an update to the implementing regulations previously promulgated for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, and we propose to retain without significant revision the majority of those provisions to implement the 2015 ozone NAAQS. This proposal addresses the timing of attainment dates for each nonattainment area classification and a range of nonattainment area state implementation plan (SIP) requirements for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. The proposed SIP requirements pertain to attainment demonstrations, reasonable further progress (RFP) and associated milestone demonstrations, reasonably available control technology (RACT), reasonably available control measures (RACM), major nonattainment new source review (NNSR), emission inventories, the timing of required SIP submissions, and compliance with emission control measures in the SIP. Other issues addressed in this proposed rule are the revocation of the 2008 ozone NAAQS, anti- backsliding requirements that would apply when the 2008 ozone NAAQS are revoked, and reconsideration of the ozone NAAQS interprecursor trading (IPT) provisions (in response to a petition for reconsideration).", 2016-27333,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/17/2016-27333/implementation-of-the-2015-national-ambient-air-quality-standards-for-ozone-nonattainment-area,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-11-17/pdf/2016-27333.pdf,11/17/2016

Addition of Nonylphenol Ethoxylates Category; Community Right-To-Know Toxic Chemical Release Reporting,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"EPA is proposing to add a nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) category to the list of toxic chemicals subject to reporting under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA). EPA is proposing to add this chemical category to the EPCRA section 313 list because EPA believes NPEs meet the EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) toxicity criteria. Specifically, EPA believes that longer chain NPEs can break down in the environment to short-chain NPEs and nonylphenol, both of which are highly toxic to aquatic organisms. Based on a review of the available production and use information, members of the NPEs category are expected to be manufactured, processed, or otherwise used in quantities that would exceed EPCRA section 313 reporting thresholds.", 2016-27547,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/16/2016-27547/addition-of-nonylphenol-ethoxylates-category-community-right-to-know-toxic-chemical-release,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-11-16/pdf/2016-27547.pdf,11/16/2016

Renewables Enhancement and Growth Support Rule,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"In this action, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to update both its renewable fuels and other fuels regulations to reflect changes in the marketplace and to promote the growing use of both ethanol fuels (conventional and advanced) and non- ethanol advanced and cellulosic biofuels. The EPA is proposing to make several changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program regulations that would align them with recent developments in the marketplace to increase production of cellulosic and other advanced biofuels. There are several companies that have developed renewable fuel production technologies that produce a ``biointermediate'' at one facility that is then processed into renewable fuel at another facility, and we are proposing regulatory changes to allow fuels produced through such methods to qualify under existing approved renewable fuel production pathways. This action also proposes to update our fuel regulations by defining fuel blends containing 16 to 83 volume percent ethanol as ethanol flex fuel (EFF) and to no longer treat fuel blends containing 16 to 50 volume percent ethanol as gasoline. The EPA is proposing environmentally protective fuel quality specifications for EFF that are consistent with those already in place for gasoline. In this action we are also proposing new pathways for cellulosic biofuel produced from short-rotation trees and for renewable diesel and biodiesel produced from non-cellulosic portions of separated food waste. We are also proposing to add new registration, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for facilities using carbon capture and storage if we were to approve the use of this technology in future assessments of proposed pathways for producing qualifying renewable fuel. We are also seeking comment on how best to implement and/or revise the RFS regulations pertaining to the generation of RINs for renewable electricity used as transportation fuel. Finally, we are proposing a number of other regulatory changes, clarifications, and technical corrections to the RFS program and other fuels regulations.", 2016-25292,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/16/2016-25292/renewables-enhancement-and-growth-support-rule,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-11-16/pdf/2016-25292.pdf,11/16/2016

"Webinar on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Revolving Loan Fund Program Changes and General Updates to PWEDA Regulations",Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; Economic Development Administration,"The Economic Development Administration (``EDA''), U.S. Department of Commerce (``DOC''), will hold a webinar to discuss proposed updates to the agency's regulations implementing the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended (``PWEDA''). On October 3, 2016, EDA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM'') in the Federal Register at 81 FR 68186. Through this NPRM, EDA is proposing important changes to the regulations governing the Revolving Loan Fund (``RLF'') program that are intended to reflect current best practices and strengthen EDA's efforts to evaluate, monitor, and improve RLF performance by establishing the Risk Analysis System, a risk-based management framework, to evaluate and manage the RLF program. EDA also proposes to reorganize the RLF regulations to improve their readability and clarify the requirements that apply to the distinct phases of an RLF award. In addition, EDA proposes specific changes to RLF requirements to make RLF awards more efficient for Recipients to administer and for EDA to monitor. Through this NPRM EDA proposes important, but less comprehensive updates to other parts of its regulations, including revising definitions, replacing references to superseded regulations to reflect the promulgation of the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements (2 CFR part 200) (``Uniform Guidance''), streamlining the provisions that outline EDA's application process, and clarifying EDA's property management regulations. Given the more comprehensive nature of the changes being proposed to the RLF program, EDA will use this webinar to focus on the proposed RLF changes and explain both the rationale behind those changes and their potential impact.

Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We are revising an earlier proposal to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2008-13-12 R1, for certain The Boeing Company Model 737- 100, -200, -200C, -300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. AD 2008-13-12 R1 requires various repetitive inspections for cracking of the upper- frame-to-side-frame splice of the fuselage, and other specified and corrective actions if necessary; and also provides for an optional preventive modification, which would terminate the repetitive inspections. This action revises the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by adding post-repair/post-modification inspections. We are proposing this SNPRM to detect and correct fatigue cracking of the upper-frame-to-side-frame splice of the fuselage, which could result in reduced structural integrity of the frame and adjacent lap joint, causing increased loading in the fuselage skin, which will accelerate skin crack growth and result in decompression of the airplane. Since these actions impose an additional burden over that proposed in the NPRM, we are reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these proposed changes.", 2016-22699,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/14/2016-22699/airworthiness-directives-the-boeing-company-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-11-14/pdf/2016-22699.pdf,11/14/2016

Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter: Revision of Federal Implementation Plan Requirements for Texas,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to withdraw the federal implementation plan (FIP) provisions that require affected electricity generating units (EGUs) in Texas to participate in Phase 2 of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) trading programs for annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) and nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>). Withdrawal of the FIP requirements is intended to address a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) remanding the CSAPR Phase 2 SO<INF>2</INF> budget for Texas to the EPA for reconsideration. The EPA is also proposing to determine that, following withdrawal of the FIP requirements, sources in Texas will not contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other state with regard to the 1997 national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>), and that the EPA therefore will have no obligation to issue new FIP requirements for Texas sources to address transported PM<INF>2.5</INF> pollution under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) with regard to that NAAQS. Finally, the proposal includes a sensitivity analysis showing that the set of actions the EPA has taken or expects to take in response to the D.C. Circuit's decision, including the removal of Texas EGUs from the two CSAPR trading programs as well as the recent removal of Florida EGUs from Phase 2 of the CSAPR trading programs for ozone- season NO<INF>X</INF> emissions, would not adversely impact the analytic demonstration for the Agency's 2012 determination that CSAPR participation meets the Regional Haze Rule's criteria to qualify as an alternative to the application of best available retrofit technology (BART).

Restrictions on Qualified Financial Contracts of Certain FDIC-Supervised Institutions; Revisions to the Definition of Qualifying Master Netting Agreement and Related Definitions,Proposed Rule,Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,"The FDIC is proposing to add a new part to its rules to improve the resolvability of systemically important U.S. banking organizations and systemically important foreign banking organizations and enhance the resilience and the safety and soundness of certain state savings associations and state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (``state non-member banks'' or ``SNMBs'') for which the FDIC is the primary federal regulator (together, ``FSIs'' or ``FDIC-supervised institutions''). Under this proposed rule, covered FSIs would be required to ensure that covered qualified financial contracts (QFCs) to which they are a party provide that any default rights and restrictions on the transfer of the QFCs are limited to the same extent as they would be under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). In addition, covered FSIs would generally be prohibited from being party to QFCs that would allow a QFC counterparty to exercise default rights against the covered FSI based on the entry into a resolution proceeding under the FDI Act, or any other resolution proceeding of an affiliate of the covered FSI. The proposal would also amend the definition of ``qualifying master netting agreement'' in the FDIC's capital and liquidity rules, and certain related terms in the FDIC's capital rules. These proposed amendments are intended to ensure that the regulatory capital and liquidity treatment of QFCs to which a covered FSI is party would not be affected by the proposed restrictions on such QFCs. The requirements of this proposed rule are substantively identical to those contained in the notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) on May 3, 2016 (FRB NPRM) regarding ``covered entities'', and the notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on August 19, 2016 (OCC NPRM), regarding ``covered banks''.", 2016-25605,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/26/2016-25605/restrictions-on-qualified-financial-contracts-of-certain-fdic-supervised-institutions-revisions-to,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-10-26/pdf/2016-25605.pdf,10/26/2016

The proposed actions are intended to prevent an ADS-B unit from communicating unreliable position information to Air Traffic Control (ATC) and nearby aircraft, resulting in a potential aircraft collision.", 2016-25255,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/20/2016-25255/airworthiness-directives-navworx-inc-automatic-dependent-surveillance-broadcast-universal-access,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-10-20/pdf/2016-25255.pdf,10/20/2016
Airworthiness Directives; The Boeing Company Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We propose to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2007-26- 04, which applies to certain Boeing Model 737-100, -200, -200C, -300, - 400, and -500 series airplanes. AD 2007-26-04 currently requires repetitive inspections for cracking around the heads of the fasteners on the forward fastener row of certain areas of a certain circumferential butt splice, and repair if necessary; and also requires a preventive modification, which eliminates the need for the repetitive inspections. Since we issued AD 2007-26-04, an evaluation by the design approval holder (DAH) indicating that the forward skin panel at a circumferential butt splice between certain stringers is subject to widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This proposed AD would remove the mandatory modification. It would add repetitive inspections of the skin for cracking at the aft fastener column and a one-time inspection for defects of the production countersunk rivets, and require corrective actions if necessary. It would also add an optional skin trim-out repair, which would terminate certain inspections. We are proposing this AD to prevent cracking of the station (STA) 259.5 circumferential butt splice, which could result in loss of structural integrity of the fuselage skin and possible loss of cabin pressure.", 2016-24262,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/20/2016-24262/airworthiness-directives-the-boeing-company-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-10-20/pdf/2016-24262.pdf,10/20/2016

AD 2012-16-08 currently requires repetitive detailed inspections for bulging, surface anomalies, and cracking of the fuselage skin adjacent to the discharge valves, and repair and application of additional sealant in the affected area if necessary. Since we issued AD 2012-16-08, it was found that airplanes on which a certain modification was incorporated during production were excluded from the applicability, but are also affected by the condition that precipitated AD 2012-16-08. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2012-16-08, expand the applicability, and require an additional one-time inspection for the presence of water traps/air driers to determine which airplanes must be inspected.

Setting and Adjusting Patent Fees During Fiscal Year 2017,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; Patent and Trademark Office,"The United States Patent and Trademark Office (Office or USPTO) proposes to set or adjust patent fees as authorized by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Act or AIA). The USPTO is a business- like operation where external factors affect the productivity of the workforce and the demand for patent products and services. The proposed fee adjustments are needed to provide the Office with a sufficient amount of aggregate revenue to recover its aggregate cost of patent operations (based on current projections), while maintaining momentum towards achieving strategic goals. This rulemaking represents the second iteration of patent fee rulemaking by the USPTO to set fees under the authority of the AIA; the first AIA patent fee setting rule was published in January 2013. This current rulemaking is a result of the USPTO assessing its costs and fees, as is consistent with federal fee setting standards. Following a biennial review of fees, costs, and revenues that began in 2015, the Office concluded that further targeted fee adjustments were necessary to continue funding patent operations, enhance patent quality, and continue to work toward patent pendency goals, strengthen the Office's information technology (IT) capability and infrastructure, and achieve operating reserve targets. Further, in several instances, the fee change proposals offered during the biennial fee review process were enhanced by the availability of cost and workload data (e.g., the number of requests for a service) that was not available in 2013. As a result, the 205 proposed fee adjustments outlined in this proposed rule align directly with the Office's strategic goals and four key fee setting policy factors, discussed in detail in Part V.", 2016-23093,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/03/2016-23093/setting-and-adjusting-patent-fees-during-fiscal-year-2017,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-10-03/pdf/2016-23093.pdf,10/03/2016
Revolving Loan Fund Program Changes and General Updates to PWEDA Regulations,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; Economic Development Administration,"Through this notice of proposed rulemaking (``NPRM''), the Economic Development Administration (``EDA''), U.S. Department of Commerce (``DOC''), proposes and requests comments on updates to the agency's regulations implementing the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended (``PWEDA''). In particular, through this NPRM EDA is proposing important changes to the regulations governing the Revolving Loan Fund (``RLF'') program that are intended to reflect current best practices and strengthen EDA's efforts to evaluate, monitor, and improve RLF performance by establishing the Risk Analysis System, a risk-based management framework, to evaluate and manage the RLF program. The proposed Risk Analysis System is modeled on the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System, commonly known as the capital adequacy, assets, management capability, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity (``CAMELS'') rating system, which has been used since 1979 to assess financial institutions on a uniform basis and to identify those in need of additional attention. EDA also proposes to reorganize the RLF regulations to improve their readability and clarify the requirements that apply to the distinct phases of an RLF award. In addition, EDA proposes specific changes to RLF requirements to make RLF awards more efficient for Recipients to administer and EDA to monitor. In addition, through this NPRM EDA proposes important, but less comprehensive updates to other parts of its regulations, including revising definitions, replacing references to superseded regulations to reflect the promulgation of the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements (2 CFR part 200) (``Uniform Guidance''), streamlining the provisions that outline EDA's application process, and clarifying EDA's property management regulations.", 2016-22287,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/03/2016-22287/revolving-loan-fund-program-changes-and-general-updates-to-pweda-regulations,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-10-03/pdf/2016-22287.pdf,10/03/2016

Amendments to the Capital Plan and Stress Test Rules,Proposed Rule,Federal Reserve System,"The Board is inviting comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the capital plan and stress test rules for bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets and U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banks. Under the proposal, large and noncomplex firms, defined below, would no longer be subject to the provisions of the Board's capital plan rule whereby the Board may object to a capital plan on the basis of qualitative deficiencies in the firm's capital planning process. In connection with this modification, large and noncomplex firms would no longer be subject to the qualitative assessment in Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), but would remain subject to a quantitative assessment in CCAR. The qualitative assessment of the capital plans of large and noncomplex firms instead would be conducted outside of CCAR through the supervisory review process. For purposes of the proposal, a bank holding company or U.S. intermediate holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or greater but less than $250 billion, on-balance sheet foreign exposure of less than $10 billion, and nonbank assets of less than $75 billion would be considered a large and noncomplex firm. The proposal would also modify reporting requirements for large and noncomplex firms to reduce burdens by raising materiality thresholds, reducing the scope of the data collection on these firms' stress test results, and reducing supporting documentation requirements. For all bank holding companies subject to the capital plan rule, the proposal would simplify the initial applicability provisions for the capital plan and stress test rules, reduce the amount of additional capital distributions that a bank holding company may make during a capital plan cycle without seeking the Board's prior approval, and extend the range of potential as-of dates for the trading and counterparty scenario component used in the stress test rules. The proposal would also amend the Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Large Holding Companies (FR Y-9LP) to include new line item 17 of PC-B Memoranda (Total nonbank assets of a holding company that is subject to the Federal Reserve Board's capital plan rule) for purposes of identifying the large and noncomplex firms. All other bank holding companies subject to the capital plan rule that are not large and noncomplex firms would remain subject to objection to their capital plan based on qualitative deficiencies under the rule. The proposal would not apply to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $50 billion or to any state member bank or savings and loan holding company.", 2016-23629,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/30/2016-23629/amendments-to-the-capital-plan-and-stress-test-rules,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-30/pdf/2016-23629.pdf,09/30/2016

Federal Baseline Water Quality Standards for Indian Reservations,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering establishing federal baseline water quality standards (WQS) for certain Indian reservation waters to narrow a long-standing gap in coverage of Clean Water Act (CWA) protections. Currently, fewer than 50 of over 300 tribes with reservations have WQS effective under the CWA; most of the reservations with existing CWA-effective WQS have obtained the coverage through treatment in a manner similar to a state (TAS) under CWA section 518. In advance of any potential rulemaking to address this gap of CWA coverage, EPA specifically invites comments on whether to establish such federal baseline WQS for Indian reservation waters that do not yet have WQS under the CWA and, if so, what those WQS should be and how they should be implemented. Federal baseline WQS would define water quality goals for unprotected reservation waters and serve as the foundation for CWA actions to protect human health and the environment. Such WQS, if established, would apply only to those waters not already covered by existing CWA-effective WQS and would be superseded by any WQS subsequently adopted by an authorized tribe and approved by EPA under CWA section 303(c).", 2016-23432,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/29/2016-23432/federal-baseline-water-quality-standards-for-indian-reservations,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-29/pdf/2016-23432.pdf,09/29/2016

This proposed rule would revise and streamline the electronic data reporting requirements of MATS (both for owners or operators of electric utility steam generating units (EGUs) who use performance stack testing and EGU owners or operators who use continuous monitoring to demonstrate compliance) and would increase data transparency. EGU owners or operators would use one familiar electronic reporting system, instead of two separate systems, reducing their burden. In addition, the public and regulatory authorities would have enhanced access to MATS data. Finally, no new continuous monitoring requirements are proposed by this action. Overall, this proposed rule would serve to ease burden, increase MATS data flow and usage, make it easier for inspectors and auditors to assess compliance, and encourage wider use of continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) for MATS compliance.", 2016-21330,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/29/2016-21330/mercury-and-air-toxics-standards-mats-completion-of-electronic-reporting-requirements,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-29/pdf/2016-21330.pdf,09/29/2016

Small Business Timber Set-Aside Program,Proposed Rule,Small Business Administration,"The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) seeks comments on a proposed amendment to its regulations governing the small business timber set-aside program (hereafter referred to as the ``timber program'') so that appraisals on small business set-aside sales be made to the nearest small business mill. Timber sale appraisals are performed for small business qualifying set-aside and non-set-aside sales. When the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Forest Service (FS) offers timber for sale, it appraises its potential market value and sets the minimum bid that it will accept based on that appraisal. Currently, appraisals in small business set-aside timber sales take into account the haul costs to the nearest mill regardless of that mill's size. Since set-aside timber sales require the use of small business mills, SBA proposes that the appraisal on set-aside timber sales be made to the nearest small business mill in order to accurately reflect the estimated cost to an eligible bidder. SBA is also requesting comment on a possible policy alternative that would use a weighted approach to appraising.", 2016-22861,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/27/2016-22861/small-business-timber-set-aside-program,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-27/pdf/2016-22861.pdf,09/27/2016

The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) may use this control date if it decides to create restrictions limiting participation in the exclusive economic zone for the Federal charter vessel/headboat (for-hire) component of the recreational sectors of the coastal migratory pelagics fishery in the Atlantic, dolphin and wahoo fishery in the Atlantic, and snapper- grouper fishery in the South Atlantic. Anyone obtaining a Federal for- hire permit for these recreational sectors after the control date will not be assured of future access should a management regime that limits participation in the sector be prepared and implemented. This announcement is intended, in part, to promote awareness of the potential eligibility criteria for future access so as to discourage speculative entry into the Federal for-hire component of the recreational sectors of the Atlantic coastal migratory pelagics, Atlantic dolphin and wahoo, or the South Atlantic snapper-grouper fisheries, while the Council and NMFS consider whether and how access to these recreational sector components should be managed.

Fisheries of the Exclusive Economic Zone Off Alaska; Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Crab Rationalization Program,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS issues a proposed rule to implement Amendment 47 to the Fishery Management Plan for Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands King and Tanner Crabs (Crab FMP) and to make minor clarifications to regulations implementing the Crab FMP. This proposed rule addresses how individual processing quota (IPQ) use caps apply to the Bering Sea Chionoecetes bairdi Tanner crab fisheries: The eastern C. bairdi Tanner (EBT) and the western C. bairdi Tanner (WBT). This proposed rule would exempt EBT and WBT IPQ crab that is custom processed at a facility through contractual arrangements with the processing facility owners from being applied against the IPQ use cap of the processing facility owners, thereby allowing a facility to process more crab without triggering the IPQ use cap. This proposed exemption is necessary to allow all of the EBT and WBT Class A individual fishing quota crab to be processed at the facilities currently processing EBT and WBT crab, and would have significant positive economic effects on the fishermen, processors, and communities that participate in the EBT and WBT fisheries. This proposed rule is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Crab FMP, and other applicable law.", 2016-22911,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/23/2016-22911/fisheries-of-the-exclusive-economic-zone-off-alaska-bering-sea-and-aleutian-islands-crab,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-23/pdf/2016-22911.pdf,09/23/2016
Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Residential Furnaces,Proposed Rule,Energy Department,"The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as amended, prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including residential furnaces. EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to periodically determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would save a significant amount of energy. On March 12, 2015, DOE published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR), in which DOE proposed amendments to the energy conservation standards for residential non-weatherized gas furnaces and mobile home gas furnaces. In response to the NOPR, DOE received comment expressing concern regarding DOE's proposed approach and encouraging the Department to examine establishing a separate product class for small furnaces. In response, DOE published a notice of data availability (NODA) in the Federal Register on September 14, 2015 that contained an analysis of a potential product class for small non-weatherized gas furnaces. In this supplemental notice of rulemaking (SNOPR), DOE responds to comments received on the NOPR and NODA and is making a modified proposal regarding amended energy conservation standards for the subject residential furnaces (including a separate small furnaces product class), which supersedes DOE's earlier proposal, as set forth in the March 12, 2015 NOPR. The notice also requests comment on the SNOPR's proposed standards and associated analyses and results. The SNOPR also proposes clarifications to the certification and reporting requirements of standby mode and off mode values for non-weatherized oil furnaces (including mobile home oil furnaces) and electric furnaces, to provide direction on the rounding of standby mode and off mode values, generally, and to clarify the level of precision for the furnace and boiler standards.", 2016-22080,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/23/2016-22080/energy-conservation-program-energy-conservation-standards-for-residential-furnaces,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-23/pdf/2016-22080.pdf,09/23/2016

Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC); Early Stage Initiative,Proposed Rule,Small Business Administration,"In this proposed rule, SBA is making changes to its Early Stage Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) initiative, which was launched in 2012 as a 5-year effort as part of President Obama's Startup America Initiative. The intent of the initiative was to license and provide SBA-guaranteed leverage to Early Stage SBICs that would focus on making investments in early stage small businesses. Although 62 investment funds applied to the program, few satisfied SBA's licensing criteria. To date, SBA has only licensed five Early Stage SBICs. In an attempt to attract more qualified early stage fund managers, this rule proposes changes to the initiative with respect to licensing, non-SBA borrowing, and leverage eligibility. These proposed changes are based in part on feedback SBA received on an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) that was published in March 2015. In addition, this rule reflects SBA's intention to continue licensing and providing SBA-guaranteed leverage to Early Stage SBICs beyond the 5- year term of the initiative, and proposes certain technical changes to SBA's Early Stage regulations.", 2016-21509,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/19/2016-21509/small-business-investment-companies-sbic-early-stage-initiative,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-19/pdf/2016-21509.pdf,09/19/2016

Model CN-235, CN-235-100, CN- 235-200, CN-235-300, and C-295 airplanes. AD 2013-23-02 currently requires an inspection of the feeder cables of certain fuel booster pumps for damage (including, but not limited to, signs of electrical arcing and fuel leaks), and replacement if necessary. Since we issued AD 2013-23-02, we have determined that a modification is necessary to address the identified unsafe condition. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2013-23-02 and would also require modification of the electrical installation of the fuel booster pumps. We are proposing this AD to prevent damage to certain fuel booster pumps, which could create an ignition source in the fuel tank vapor space, and result in a fuel tank explosion and consequent loss of the airplane.", 2016-22434,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/19/2016-22434/airworthiness-directives-airbus-defense-and-space-sa-formerly-known-as-construcciones-aeronauticas,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-19/pdf/2016-22434.pdf,09/19/2016

This proposed AD was prompted by a report of certain tie rod assemblies installed on the hinged fairing assembly of the main landing gear (MLG) with no cadmium plating on the rod end threads. This proposed AD would require a detailed inspection of certain tie rod assemblies installed on the hinged fairing assembly of the MLG for the presence of cadmium plating, and replacement of tie rod assemblies without cadmium plating. We are proposing this AD to detect and correct the absence of cadmium plating on the rod end threads of the tie rod assemblies. The absence of cadmium plating could lead to galvanic corrosion of the tie rod end threads, resulting in rod end failure, loss of a MLG door, and consequent damage to the airplane.", 2016-22435,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/19/2016-22435/airworthiness-directives-airbus-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-19/pdf/2016-22435.pdf,09/19/2016

We have determined that, based on the best scientific and commercial data available, and after taking into account efforts being made to protect these species, both species meet the definition of a threatened species under the ESA. Therefore, we propose to list both species as threatened species under the ESA. We are not proposing to designate critical habitat for either of the species proposed for listing because the geographical areas occupied by these species are entirely outside U.S. jurisdiction.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants: Proposed Rule To List the Maui's Dolphin as Endangered and the South Island Hector's Dolphin as Threatened Under the Endangered Species Act,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"We, NMFS, propose to list the Maui's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori maui) as endangered and the South Island Hector's dolphin (C. hectori hectori) as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We have reviewed the best available scientific and commercial data and completed a comprehensive status review for these two subspecies of Hector's dolphin (C. hectori). The Maui's dolphin faces serious demographic risks due to critically low abundance, a low population growth rate, a restricted range, low genetic diversity, and ongoing threats such as bycatch in commercial and recreational gillnets. We have determined Maui's dolphin is currently in danger of extinction throughout its range and, therefore, meets the definition of an endangered species. The relatively more abundant and more widely distributed South Island Hector's dolphin has experienced large historical declines and is expected to continue to slowly decline due to bycatch and other lesser threats, such as disease and impacts associated with tourism. We have determined that this subspecies is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, but is likely to become so within the foreseeable future; and therefore, it meets the definition of a threatened species. Both subspecies occur only in New Zealand. We are authorized to designate critical habitat within U.S. jurisdiction only, and we are not aware of any areas within U.S jurisdiction that may meet the definition of critical habitat under the ESA. Therefore, we are not proposing to designate critical habitat. We are soliciting public comments on our status review report and proposal to list these two subspecies.", 2016-22451,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/19/2016-22451/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-proposed-rule-to-list-the-mauis-dolphin-as-endangered,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-19/pdf/2016-22451.pdf,09/19/2016

The marketing order regulates the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California, and is administered locally by the Committee. Recently, the U.S. Standards for Grades of Processed Raisins (standards) were amended to remove the word ``midget.'' The proposed change would make the marketing order consistent with the amended standards.

Airworthiness Directives; Embraer S.A. Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We are revising an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 170 airplanes. The NPRM proposed to supersede AD 2012-07-08, which requires revising the maintenance or inspection program to incorporate structural inspection requirements. The NPRM was prompted by a determination that more restrictive maintenance requirements and airworthiness limitations are necessary. Since the NPRM was issued, a new revision of the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the EMBRAER S.A. ERJ 170/175 Maintenance Review Board Report (MRBR) was issued, which contains more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This action revises the NPRM by proposing to require revising the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate the new ALS of the MRBR. This supplemental NPRM (SNPRM) would also remove certain airplanes from the applicability. In addition, we propose to supersede AD 2006-06-09, AD 2012-05-08, and AD 2012-07-08, which require tasks that are now included in the new revision of the MRBR. We are proposing this SNPRM to detect and correct fatigue cracking of various principal structural elements; such cracking could result in reduced structural integrity of the airplane. We are also proposing this SNPRM to prevent safety-significant latent failures; such failures, in combination with one or more other specified failures or events, could result in a hazardous or catastrophic failure condition of avionics, hydraulic systems, fire detection systems, fuel systems, or other critical systems. In addition, we are also proposing this SNPRM to prevent the potential for ignition sources inside fuel tanks caused by latent failures, alterations, repairs, or maintenance actions; such failures, in combination with flammable fuel vapors, could result in fuel tank explosions and consequent loss of the airplane. Since these actions impose an additional burden over those proposed in the NPRM, we are reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these proposed changes.", 2016-21145,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/12/2016-21145/airworthiness-directives-embraer-sa-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-12/pdf/2016-21145.pdf,09/12/2016

Since we issued AD 2014-26-08, we have determined that more restrictive maintenance instructions and airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or revised airworthiness limitation requirements.

We are proposing this AD to prevent safety-significant latent failures that would, in combination with one or more other specific failures or events, result in a hazardous or catastrophic failure condition.", 2016-21164,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/12/2016-21164/airworthiness-directives-airbus-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-12/pdf/2016-21164.pdf,09/12/2016
Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Airplanes,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"We propose to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2011-10- 17, for all Airbus Model A300 and A310 series airplanes, and Model A300 B4-600, B4-600R, and F4-600R series airplanes, and Model C4-605R Variant F airplanes (collectively called A300-600 series airplanes). AD 2011-10-17 currently requires revising the maintenance program by incorporating certain airworthiness limitation items (ALIs). Since we issued AD 2011-10-17, the manufacturer has revised certain ALI documents, which specify more restrictive instructions and/or airworthiness limitations. This proposed AD would require revising the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or revised structural inspection requirements. This proposed AD would also remove Model A310 and A300-600 series airplanes from the applicability. We are proposing this AD to detect and correct fatigue cracking, damage, and corrosion in certain structure; such fatigue cracking, damage, and corrosion could result in reduced structural integrity of the airplane.", 2016-21149,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/12/2016-21149/airworthiness-directives-airbus-airplanes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-12/pdf/2016-21149.pdf,09/12/2016
Energy Labeling Rule,Proposed Rule,Federal Trade Commission,"The Commission proposes amendments to the Energy Labeling Rule to require labels for portable air conditioners, large-diameter and high-speed small diameter ceiling fans, and instantaneous electric water heaters. Additionally, it proposes eliminating certain marking requirements for plumbing products.", 2016-21783,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/12/2016-21783/energy-labeling-rule,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-12/pdf/2016-21783.pdf,09/12/2016
Exhibit Hyperlinks and HTML Format,Proposed Rule,Securities and Exchange Commission,"We are proposing amendments that would require registrants that file registration statements and periodic and current reports that are subject to the exhibit requirements under Item 601 of Regulation S- K, or that file on Forms F-10 or 20-F, to include a hyperlink to each exhibit listed in the exhibit index of these filings. To enable the inclusion of such hyperlinks, the proposed amendments would also require that registrants submit all such filings in HyperText Markup Language (``HTML'') format.", 2016-21313,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/12/2016-21313/exhibit-hyperlinks-and-html-format,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-12/pdf/2016-21313.pdf,09/12/2016
