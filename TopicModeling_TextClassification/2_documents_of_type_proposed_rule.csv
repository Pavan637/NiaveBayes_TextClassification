VA Compensation and Pension Regulation Rewrite Project,Proposed Rule,Veterans Affairs Department,"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on November 27, 2013, proposing to reorganize and rewrite its compensation and pension regulations in a logical, claimant focused, and user-friendly format. The intended effect of the proposed revisions was to assist claimants, beneficiaries, veterans' representatives, and VA personnel in locating and understanding these regulations. VA has since determined that an incremental approach to revising these regulations is the only feasible method for the Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA) as it exists today. Therefore, VA is withdrawing the proposed rule, RIN 2900-AO13-VA Compensation and Pension Regulation Rewrite Project, that was published on November 27, 2013, at 78 FR 71,042.", 2018-07078,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/06/2018-07078/va-compensation-and-pension-regulation-rewrite-project,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-04-06/pdf/2018-07078.pdf,04/06/2018
Definition of Domiciliary Care,Proposed Rule,Veterans Affairs Department,"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its rule defining domiciliary care, to accurately reflect the scope of services currently provided under the Domiciliary Care Program. VA's Domiciliary Care Program provides a temporary home to certain veterans, which includes the furnishing of shelter, goods, clothing and other comforts of home, as well as medical services. In 2005 VA designated its Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (MH RRTP) as a type of domiciliary care. MH RRTP provides clinically intensive residential rehabilitative services to certain mental health patient populations. We propose to amend the definition of domiciliary care to reflect that domiciliary care includes MH RRTP. In addition, VA domiciliary care, as a matter of long-standing practice, includes non-permanent housing, but this is not clear in the regulation. The proposed rule would clarify that domiciliary care provides temporary, not permanent, residence to affected veterans.", 2018-07082,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/06/2018-07082/definition-of-domiciliary-care,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-04-06/pdf/2018-07082.pdf,04/06/2018

National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Wet-Formed Fiberglass Mat Production Residual Risk and Technology Review,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Wet-Formed Fiberglass Mat Production to address the results of the residual risk and technology review (RTR) that the EPA is required to conduct in accordance with section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). We found risks due to emissions of air toxics to be acceptable from this source category, determined that the current standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health, and identified no new cost-effective controls under the technology review to achieve further emissions reductions. Therefore, we are proposing no revisions to the numerical emission limits based on these analyses. However, the EPA is proposing to revise provisions pertaining to emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM); add requirements for electronic submittal of performance test results; revise certain monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements; and make other miscellaneous technical and editorial changes. While the proposed amendments would not result in reductions in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP), if finalized, they would result in improved compliance and implementation of the rule.", 2018-06541,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/06/2018-06541/national-emission-standards-for-hazardous-air-pollutants-wet-formed-fiberglass-mat-production,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-04-06/pdf/2018-06541.pdf,04/06/2018

Bump-Stock-Type Devices,Proposed Rule,"Justice Department; Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives Bureau","The Department of Justice (Department) proposes to amend the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives regulations to clarify that ``bump fire'' stocks, slide-fire devices, and devices with certain similar characteristics (bump-stock-type devices) are ``machineguns'' as defined by the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) and the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), because such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger. Specifically, these devices convert an otherwise semiautomatic firearm into a machinegun by functioning as a self-acting or self-regulating mechanism that harnesses the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter. Hence, a semiautomatic firearm to which a bump-stock-type device is attached is able to produce automatic fire with a single pull of the trigger. With limited exceptions, primarily as to government agencies, the GCA makes it unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun unless it was lawfully possessed prior to the effective date of the statute. The bump-stock-type devices covered by this proposed rule were not in existence prior to the GCA's effective date, and therefore would fall within the prohibition on machineguns if this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) is implemented. Consequently, current possessors of these devices would be required to surrender them, destroy them, or otherwise render them permanently inoperable upon the effective date of the final rule.", 2018-06292,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/29/2018-06292/bump-stock-type-devices,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-03-29/pdf/2018-06292.pdf,03/29/2018

Butamax has submitted information that would likely satisfy the applicable registration requirements. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to register a fuel or fuel additive once all the applicable registration requirements have been met by the manufacturer. Due to the potential for the widespread introduction of isobutanol into commerce, we are taking steps to make the public aware of the likelihood of this registration.

Internet Communication Disclaimers and Definition of “Public Communication”,Proposed Rule,Federal Election Commission,"The Federal Election Commission requests comment on two alternative proposals to amend its regulations concerning disclaimers on public communications on the internet that contain express advocacy, solicit contributions, or are made by political committees. The Commission is undertaking this rulemaking in light of technological advances since the Commission last revised its rules governing internet disclaimers in 2006, and questions from the public about the application of those rules to internet communications. The Commission's goal is to promulgate a rule that in its text and interpretation recognizes the paramount importance of providing the public with the clearest disclosure of the payor or sponsor of these public communications on the internet. Both proposals are intended to give the American public easy access to information about the persons paying for and candidates authorizing these internet communications, pursuant to the Federal Election Campaign Act. Both proposals would continue to require disclaimers for certain internet communications, and both would allow certain internet communications to provide disclaimers through alternative technology. The proposals differ, however, in their approach. The Commission requests comment on all elements of both proposals. The two proposals need not be considered as fixed alternatives; commenters are encouraged to extract the best elements of each, or suggest improvements or alternatives, to help the Commission fashion the best possible rule.

Further, FMCSA requests comment on certain specific regulatory requirements that are likely to be affected by an increased integration of ADS-equipped CMVs. However, the Agency is not seeking comments on its financial responsibility requirements because they are not directly related to CMV technologies and because future insurance requirements will depend in part on the evolution of State tort law with respect to liability for the operation of ADS-equipped vehicles. In addition, to support FMCSA's effort to understand future impacts on the FMCSR's, FMCSA requests information, including from companies engaged in the design, development, testing, and integration of ADS-equipped CMVs into the fleet. Specifically, the Agency requests information about: The scenarios and environments where entities expect that ADS will soon be tested and integrated into CMVs operating on public roads or in interstate commerce; the operational design domains (ODD) in which these systems are being operated or would be tested and eventually deployed; and, measures they believe are required to ensure the protection of any proprietary or confidential business information they intend to share with the Agency.", 2018-05788,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/26/2018-05788/request-for-comments-concerning-federal-motor-carrier-safety-regulations-fmcsrs-which-may-be-a,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-03-26/pdf/2018-05788.pdf,03/26/2018

Tobacco Product Standard for Nicotine Level of Combusted Cigarettes,Proposed Rule,Health and Human Services Department; Food and Drug Administration,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to obtain information for consideration in developing a tobacco product standard to set the maximum nicotine level for cigarettes. Because tobacco-related harms ultimately result from addiction to the nicotine in such products, causing repeated use and exposure to toxicants, FDA is considering taking this action to reduce the level of nicotine in these products so they are minimally addictive or nonaddictive, using the best available science to determine a level that is appropriate for the protection of the public health. FDA is using the term ``nonaddictive'' in this document specifically in the context of a potentially nonaddictive cigarette. We acknowledge the highly addictive potential of nicotine itself depending upon the route of delivery. As discussed elsewhere in this document, questions remain with respect to the precise level of nicotine in cigarettes that might render them either minimally addictive or nonaddictive for specific members or segments of the population. We envision the potential circumstance where nicotine levels in cigarettes do not spur or sustain addiction for some portion of potential smokers. This could give addicted users the choice and ability to quit more easily, and it could help to prevent experimenters (mainly youth) from initiating regular use and becoming regular smokers. The scope of products covered by any potential product standard will be one issue for comment in the ANPRM. Any additional scientific data and research relevant to the empirical basis for regulatory decisions related to a nicotine tobacco product standard is another issue for comment in the ANPRM.", 2018-05345,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/16/2018-05345/tobacco-product-standard-for-nicotine-level-of-combusted-cigarettes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-03-16/pdf/2018-05345.pdf,03/16/2018

Hiring Flexibility Under Professional Standards,Proposed Rule,Agriculture Department; Food and Nutrition Service,"This proposed rule would add four flexibilities to the hiring standards for new school nutrition program directors in small local educational agencies (LEAs) and new school nutrition program State directors under the professional standards regulations for the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. First, to address the hiring challenge faced by small LEAs, those with 2,499 or fewer students, this rule would require relevant food service experience rather than school nutrition program experience for new directors. Second, it would provide State agencies with discretion to consider volunteer or unpaid work as relevant food service experience for new school nutrition program directors in small LEAs. Third, to further assist LEAs with less than 500 students, this proposed rule would expand the existing regulatory flexibility which gives State agencies discretion to accept less than the required years of food service experience when an applicant for a new director position has the minimum required education. Fourth, this rule would also add flexibility to the hiring standards for State directors of school nutrition programs by considering applicants with either a bachelor's or a master's degree in specific, relevant fields.

Fisheries Off West Coast States; Highly Migratory Fisheries; Amendment 4 to Fishery Management Plan for West Coast Highly Migratory Species Fisheries; Revisions to the Biennial Management Cycle,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"Based on a recommendation from the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) NMFS is proposing to revise regulations under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) to implement Amendment 4 to the Fishery Management Plan for U.S. West Coast Highly Migratory Species (HMS FMP). The intent of Amendment 4 is to bring descriptions of the management context for HMS fisheries up to date, to better describe the Council's role in the process of making stock status determinations for highly migratory species (HMS), including the Council's evaluations of the best scientific information available (BSIA), and to change the schedule of the Council's three- meeting biennial management cycle for HMS stocks. Consistent with Amendment 4, this proposed rule would update and amend the descriptions of biennial management cycle activities in the regulations for the HMS FMP to allow the Council to shift the schedule of Council meetings for the consideration of HMS management actions from June, September, and November to September, November, and March. The changes proposed to biennial management cycle activities and the schedule are intended to better streamline international and domestic management processes for HMS. Amendment 4 and this proposed rule are administrative in nature and are not expected to affect activities authorized under the FMP or harvest levels of HMS.", 2018-03963,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/27/2018-03963/fisheries-off-west-coast-states-highly-migratory-fisheries-amendment-4-to-fishery-management-plan,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-02-27/pdf/2018-03963.pdf,02/27/2018

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Requirements and Services for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents; Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,Proposed Rule,Agriculture Department; Food and Nutrition Service,"The Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended (the Act), limits the amount of time an able-bodied adult without dependents (ABAWD) can receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to 3 months in a 36-month period, unless the individual is working and/or participating in a work program half-time or more, or participating in workfare. The Act exempts individuals from the time limit for several reasons, including age, unfitness for work, or having a dependent child. The Act also provides State agencies with flexibility to request a waiver of this time limit if unemployment is high or the area does not have a sufficient number of jobs to provide employment. Moreover, the Act gives States discretion to exempt 15 percent of the individuals who would otherwise be subject to the time limit. The Department of Agriculture's (Department's) policy goal is to address food insecurity by providing supplemental food assistance and helping able-bodied SNAP participants move out of poverty and into work in a manner that is consistent with the structure and the intent of the Act.

Margin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities; Proposed Rule,Proposed Rule,Treasury Department; Comptroller of the Currency; Federal Reserve System; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; Farm Credit Administration; Federal Housing Finance Agency,"The Board, OCC, FDIC, FCA, and FHFA (each an Agency and, collectively, the Agencies) are seeking comment on proposed amendments to the minimum margin requirements for registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security- based swap participants for which one of the Agencies is the prudential regulator (Swap Margin Rule). The Agencies are proposing these amendments in light of the rules recently adopted by the Board, the OCC, and the FDIC that impose restrictions on certain non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps and other financial contracts (Covered QFCs) (the QFC Rules). The QFC Rules amend the definition of ``Qualifying Master Netting Agreement'' in the Federal banking agencies' regulatory capital and liquidity rules to ensure that a Covered QFC is not prevented from being part of a Qualifying Master Netting Agreement solely because the Covered QFC conforms to the new requirements in the QFC Rules. The FCA also plans to propose amendments to its capital rules, including potential revisions to its regulatory definition of ``Qualifying Master Netter Agreement,'' which is expected to be identical to the definition used in the Federal banking agencies' regulatory capital and liquidity rules. The Agencies are proposing to amend the definition of ``Eligible Master Netting Agreement'' in the Swap Margin Rule so that it remains harmonized with the amended definition of ``Qualifying Master Netting Agreement'' in the Federal banking agencies' regulatory capital and liquidity rules, and amendments to the capital rules that the FCA separately plans to propose. This proposed rule would also ensure that netting agreements of firms subject to the Swap Margin Rule are not excluded from the definition of ``Eligible Master Netting Agreement'' based solely on their compliance with the QFC Rules. The Agencies are also proposing that any legacy non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap (i.e., a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security- based swap entered into before the applicable compliance date) that is not subject to the margin requirements of the Swap Margin Rule would not become subject to the provisions of the Swap Margin Rule if the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap is amended solely to comply with the requirements of the QFC Rules.", 2018-02560,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/21/2018-02560/margin-and-capital-requirements-for-covered-swap-entities-proposed-rule,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-02-21/pdf/2018-02560.pdf,02/21/2018

This submission addresses the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) requirements applicable to Alabama state boards or agency personnel with respect to the approval of permits or enforcement orders. The submission also specifically addresses requirements for implementation of the following national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS): 1997, 2006, and 2012 Fine Particulate Matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>), 2008 8-hour Ozone, 2008 Lead, 2010 Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>), and 2010 Sulfur Dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>). The CAA requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance and enforcement of each NAAQS promulgated by EPA. Whenever EPA promulgates a new or revised NAAQS, the CAA requires the state to make a new SIP submission establishing that the existing SIP meets the various applicable requirements, or revising the SIP to meet those requirements. This type of SIP submission is commonly referred to as an ``infrastructure'' SIP. In this proposed action, EPA is proposing to approve the October 24, 2017, submission with respect to: (1) The requirements applicable to state boards of the CAA; and (2) the related state board infrastructure SIP requirements for the 1997, 2006, and 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF>, 2008 8-hour Ozone, 2008 Lead, 2010 NO<INF>2</INF>, and 2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS.

Modification of Significant New Use of a Certain Chemical Substance,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"EPA is proposing to amend the significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for Oxazolidine, 3,3'-methylenebis[5-methyl-, which was the subject of a premanufacture notice (PMN) and a significant new use notice (SNUN). This action would amend the SNUR to allow certain new uses reported in the SNUN without requiring additional SNUNs and make the lack of certain worker protections a new use. EPA is proposing this amendment based on review of new and existing data as described for the chemical substance. A SNUR requires persons who intend to manufacture (including import) or process this chemical substance for an activity that is designated as a significant new use by this proposed rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity. The required notification initiates EPA's evaluation of the intended use within the applicable review period.

Streamlining the Single Application and Clarifying Eligibility Requirements,Proposed Rule,"Library of Congress; Copyright Office, Library of Congress","On December 16, 2017, the U.S. Copyright Office released a new version of the Single Application, an online registration option that allows a single author to register a claim in one work that is solely owned by the same author and is not a work made for hire. The new Single Application includes enhanced features that should improve the user experience, increase the efficiency of the examination, and reduce the correspondence rate for these types of claims. To coincide with these technical upgrades, the Office is now proposing to amend its regulations to clarify the eligibility requirements for the Single Application, and codify certain practices set forth in the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, Third Edition. In addition, the proposed rule confirms that the Single Application may be used to register one sound recording and one musical work, literary work, or dramatic work--notwithstanding the fact that a sound recording and the work embodied in that recording are separate works. The proposed rule will also clarify the eligibility requirements for the Office's Standard Application, which is used to register certain works that are ineligible for the Single Application, such as works with more than one owner. In addition, the proposed rule will eliminate the ``short form'' version of the Office's paper applications, and make technical amendments to the regulations governing preregistration, architectural works, mask works, vessel designs, the unit of publication registration option, and the group registration option for database updates.

Removing Regulatory Barriers for Vehicles With Automated Driving Systems,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,"NHTSA seeks public comments to identify any regulatory barriers in the existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) to the testing, compliance certification and compliance verification of motor vehicles with Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) and certain unconventional interior designs. NHTSA is focusing primarily, but not exclusively, on vehicles with ADSs that lack controls for a human driver; e.g., steering wheel, brake pedal or accelerator pedal. The absence of manual driving controls, and thus of a human driver, poses potential barriers to testing, compliance certification and compliance verification. For example, many of the FMVSS refer to the ``driver'' or ``driver's seating position'' in specifying where various vehicle features and systems need to be located so that they can be seen and/or used by a person sitting in that position. Further, the compliance test procedures of some FMVSS depend on the presence of such things as a human test driver who can follow instructions on test driving maneuvers or a steering wheel that can be used by an automated steering machine. NHTSA also seeks comments on the research that would be needed to determine how to amend the FMVSS in order to remove such barriers, while retaining those existing safety requirements that will be needed and appropriate for those vehicles. In all cases, the Agency's goal would be to ensure the maintenance of currently required levels of safety performance. These comments will aid the Agency in setting research priorities as well as inform its subsequent actions to lay a path for innovative vehicle designs and technologies that feature ADSs.", 2018-00671,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/01/18/2018-00671/removing-regulatory-barriers-for-vehicles-with-automated-driving-systems,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-01-18/pdf/2018-00671.pdf,01/18/2018

Floating Cabin Regulation,Proposed Rule,Tennessee Valley Authority,"The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is proposing to amend its regulations that govern floating cabins located on the Tennessee River and its tributaries. The mooring of floating cabins on the TVA reservoir system has increased, and TVA has determined that this poses an unacceptable risk to navigation, safety, and the environment. Left unaddressed, floating cabins convert the public waters under TVA's management to private use. The proposed amendments would re-define nonnavigable houseboats and floating cabins using one term--``floating cabins''--and prohibit new floating cabins on TVA-managed reservoirs after December 16, 2016. The proposed amendments also include limited mooring standards, limitations on expansions of floating cabins, and requirements for owners to register their floating cabins. Additional health, safety, and environmental standards for floating cabins will be addressed in a later rulemaking once TVA has had the opportunity to discuss such standards with various stakeholders. In addition, and separate from the updated rule amendments for floating cabins, these proposed amendments contain a minor changes to clarify when TVA will allow some water-use facilities (e.g., docks) to be as large as 1,800 square feet.", 2018-00323,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/01/17/2018-00323/floating-cabin-regulation,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-01-17/pdf/2018-00323.pdf,01/17/2018

The EPA previously proposed to disapprove YSAQMD's 2006 RACT SIP submittal for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS because we found that existing District rules implemented RACT for many but not all applicable sources. The YSAQMD has since addressed these deficiencies by adopting approvable rules that implement RACT and by adopting negative declarations where the District concluded it had no sources subject to RACT requirements. Therefore, we withdraw our previous proposed disapproval of YSAQMD's 2006 RACT SIP and now propose to approve it into the California SIP. The EPA is also proposing to approve YSAQMD's negative declarations into the SIP for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. We are proposing to approve local SIP revisions under the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act).

Definition of “Employer” Under Section 3(5) of ERISA-Association Health Plans,Proposed Rule,Labor Department; Employee Benefits Security Administration,"This document contains a proposed regulation under Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) that would broaden the criteria under ERISA section 3(5) for determining when employers may join together in an employer group or association that is treated as the ``employer'' sponsor of a single multiple-employer ``employee welfare benefit plan'' and ``group health plan'' as those terms are defined in Title I of ERISA. By treating the association itself as the employer sponsor of a single plan, the regulation would facilitate the adoption and administration of such arrangements. The regulation would modify the definition of ``employer,'' in part, by creating a more flexible ``commonality of interest'' test for the employer members than the Department of Labor (DOL or Department) had adopted in sub- regulatory interpretive rulings under ERISA section 3(5). At the same time, the regulation would continue to distinguish employment-based plans, the focal point of Title I of ERISA, from mere commercial insurance programs and administrative service arrangements marketed to employers. For purposes of Title I of ERISA, the proposal would also permit working owners of an incorporated or unincorporated trade or business, including partners in a partnership, to elect to act as employers for purposes of participating in an employer group or association sponsoring a health plan and also to be treated as employees with respect to a trade, business or partnership for purposes of being covered by the employer group's or association's health plan. The goal of the rulemaking is to expand access to affordable health coverage, especially among small employers and self-employed individuals, by removing undue restrictions on the establishment and maintenance of association health plans under ERISA. The proposed regulation would affect such association health plans, health coverage under these health plans, groups and associations of employers sponsoring such plans, participants and beneficiaries with health coverage under these plans, health insurance issuers, and purchasers of health insurance not purchased through association health plans.", 2017-28103,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/01/05/2017-28103/definition-of-employer-under-section-35-of-erisa-association-health-plans,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-01-05/pdf/2017-28103.pdf,01/05/2018

Proposed Rule; Renewable Fuel Standard Program; Grain Sorghum Oil Pathway,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"In this proposed rule, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing an opportunity to comment on an analysis of the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with certain biofuels that are produced from grain sorghum oil extracted at dry mill ethanol plants at any point downstream from sorghum grinding, also known as distiller sorghum oil. EPA seeks comment on its proposed assessment that using distillers sorghum oil as feedstock results in no significant agricultural sector GHG emissions; and that biodiesel and heating oil produced from distillers sorghum oil via a transesterification process, and renewable diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, naphtha, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) produced from distillers sorghum oil via a hydrotreating process, would meet the lifecycle GHG emissions reduction threshold of 50 percent required for advanced biofuels, and biomass-based diesel under the Renewable Fuel Standard program. Based on these analyses, EPA is proposing to amend the RFS program regulations to define the term ``distillers sorghum oil''. We also propose to add to the regulations approved pathways from the production of biodiesel and heating oil from distillers sorghum oil via a transesterification process, and renewable diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, naphtha, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) produced from distillers sorghum oil via a hydrotreating process.", 2017-27946,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/27/2017-27946/proposed-rule-renewable-fuel-standard-program-grain-sorghum-oil-pathway,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-12-27/pdf/2017-27946.pdf,12/27/2017
Water Quality Standards for the State of Missouri's Lakes and Reservoirs,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) proposes to establish federal nutrient criteria to protect designated uses for the State of Missouri's lakes and reservoirs. On August 16, 2011, EPA disapproved most of the numeric criteria for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a that the State submitted to EPA in 2009. EPA acknowledged the importance of Missouri's proactive efforts to address nutrient pollution by adopting numeric nutrient criteria. However, EPA concluded that the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) had failed to demonstrate the criteria would protect the State's designated uses and were not based on a sound scientific rationale. The Clean Water Act (CWA) directs EPA to promptly propose water quality standards (WQS) that meet CWA requirements if a state does not adopt WQS addressing EPA's disapproval. On February 24, 2016, the Missouri Coalition for the Environment (MCE) filed a lawsuit alleging that EPA failed to satisfy its statutory obligation to act ``promptly.'' On December 1, 2016, EPA entered into a consent decree with MCE committing to sign a notice of proposed rulemaking by December 15, 2017 to address EPA's 2011 disapproval, unless the State submits and EPA approves criteria that address the disapproval on or before December 15, 2017. As of the date of this proposed rule, Missouri has not submitted new or revised standards to address EPA's 2011 disapproval and EPA has not approved such water quality standards. Therefore, under the terms of the consent decree, EPA is signing a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposes new water quality standards addressing EPA's August 16, 2011 disapproval. In this proposal, EPA seeks comment on two primary alternatives. Under the first alternative, EPA proposes nutrient protection values and eutrophication impact factors in a combined criterion approach. Under the second alternative, EPA proposes a similar combined criterion approach that would mirror the State of Missouri's October 2017 proposal for lake nutrient water quality standards. EPA will not proceed with final rulemaking (or will withdraw its final rule, if applicable) to address its 2011 disapproval if Missouri adopts and submits criteria to address EPA's 2011 disapproval and EPA approves them as meeting CWA requirements.", 2017-27621,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/27/2017-27621/water-quality-standards-for-the-state-of-missouris-lakes-and-reservoirs,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-12-27/pdf/2017-27621.pdf,12/27/2017

Federal Reserve Policy on Payment System Risk; U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banking Organizations,Proposed Rule,Federal Reserve System,"The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board'') is requesting comment on proposed changes to part II of the Federal Reserve Policy on Payment System Risk (``PSR policy'') related to procedures for determining the net debit cap and maximum daylight overdraft capacity of a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign banking organization (``FBO''). Under the PSR policy, an FBO's strength of support assessment (``SOSA'') ranking can affect its eligibility for a positive net debit cap, the size of its net debit cap, and its eligibility to request a streamlined procedure to obtain maximum daylight overdraft capacity. Additionally, an FBO that is a financial holding company (``FHC'') can generally receive a higher net debit cap than an FBO that is not an FHC, and is generally eligible to request a streamlined procedure to obtain maximum daylight overdraft capacity. The proposed changes to the PSR policy would remove references to the SOSA ranking; remove references to FBOs' FHC status; and adopt alternative methods for determining an FBO's eligibility for a positive net debit cap, the size of its net debit cap, and its eligibility to request a streamlined procedure to obtain maximum daylight overdraft capacity. The Board recognizes that the proposed changes would reduce net debit caps for some FBOs, but the Board believes that the adjusted FBO net debit caps would be better tailored to FBOs' actual usage of intraday credit and would not constrain FBOs' U.S. operations.", 2017-26923,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/14/2017-26923/federal-reserve-policy-on-payment-system-risk-us-branches-and-agencies-of-foreign-banking,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-12-14/pdf/2017-26923.pdf,12/14/2017

AD 2015- 15-13 requires modification of the potable water service panel and waste water service panel, including doing applicable related investigative and corrective actions. Since we issued AD 2015-15-13, further investigations linked to widespread fatigue damage (WFD) analysis highlighted that, to meet the WFD requirements, it is necessary that the affected modification not be accomplished before reaching a certain threshold. This proposed AD would require modification of the waste water and potable water service panels with new compliance times.

Fisheries of the Exclusive Economic Zone Off Alaska; Halibut Bycatch Management in the Groundfish Fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS, in consultation with the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on a new halibut bycatch management program for groundfish fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI), in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The proposed action would create a new method of managing halibut bycatch that links halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits for the groundfish fisheries to data on halibut abundance. The proposed action is intended to provide a responsive approach for managing halibut bycatch at varying levels of halibut abundance. The new program would minimize halibut bycatch to the extent practicable while achieving, on a continuing basis, optimum yield from the groundfish fisheries. The new management program also could provide additional opportunity for the directed halibut fishery at low levels of halibut abundance compared to the status quo and promote conservation of the halibut spawning stock biomass, particularly at low levels of abundance. The EIS will analyze the impacts to the human environment resulting from the proposed bycatch management program. NMFS will accept written comments from the public to identify the issues of concern and assist the Council in determining the appropriate range of management alternatives for the EIS.", 2017-26734,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/12/2017-26734/fisheries-of-the-exclusive-economic-zone-off-alaska-halibut-bycatch-management-in-the-groundfish,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-12-12/pdf/2017-26734.pdf,12/12/2017

International Fisheries; Pacific Tuna Fisheries; Revised 2018 Commercial Fishing Restrictions for Pacific Bluefin Tuna in the Eastern Pacific Ocean; 2018 Catch Limit,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is proposing regulations under the Tuna Conventions Act to revise trip limits on the commercial catch of Pacific bluefin tuna applicable to 2018. U.S. commercial fishing vessels are subject to a biennial limit for 2017 and 2018. Preliminary estimates indicate that the catch limit in 2018 is approximately 120 metric tons (mt). To avoid exceeding the biennial limit, NMFS is proposing a 1-mt trip limit--except for large-mesh drift gillnet vessels, which would be subject to a 2-mt trip limit-- throughout 2018 or until the 2018 catch limit is reached and the fishery is closed. This action is necessary to contribute to the rebuilding of Pacific bluefin tuna and for the United States to satisfy its obligations as a member of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC).", 2017-26146,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/07/2017-26146/international-fisheries-pacific-tuna-fisheries-revised-2018-commercial-fishing-restrictions-for,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-12-07/pdf/2017-26146.pdf,12/07/2017

Recognition of Pilot in Command Experience in the Military and in Part 121 Air Carrier Operations,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) would allow pilots who obtained pilot in command (PIC) experience prior to July 31, 2013, in certain air carrier operations, to count that time towards the 1,000 hours of air carrier experience required to serve as a PIC in air carrier operations today. This would correct an inadvertent omission in the Pilot Certification and Qualification Requirements for Air Carrier Operations final rule that established the air carrier experience requirement. It would also broaden the existing 500-hour credit military pilots of fixed-wing airplanes can use towards the 1,000 hours of air carrier experience by permitting pilots of select powered-lift aircraft operations to receive credit. This NPRM would also allow credit for select military time in a powered-lift aircraft flown in horizontal flight towards the 250 hours of airplane time as PIC, or second in command (SIC) performing the duties of PIC, required for an airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate.", 2017-25358,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/11/24/2017-25358/recognition-of-pilot-in-command-experience-in-the-military-and-in-part-121-air-carrier-operations,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-11-24/pdf/2017-25358.pdf,11/24/2017

Fisheries Off West Coast States; Coastal Pelagic Species Fisheries; Amendment 16 to the Coastal Pelagic Species Fishery Management Plan,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 16 of the Coastal Pelagic Species (CPS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The purpose of this proposed rule is to amend the CPS regulations to allow for very small amounts of directed, non-live bait fishing on CPS finfish to occur when a fishery is otherwise closed to directed fishing. Currently, when directed fishing closures are enacted, a small sector of the CPS fishery that is not part of the primary commercial directed fishery has been precluded from fishing and/or harvesting even minor amounts because this activity does not fall under the existing exemptions during closures for incidental harvest or for harvesting CPS to be sold as live bait. NMFS is proposing changes to the CPS regulations to allow this sector to continue directed fishing after other directed fisheries are closed, unless otherwise specified or if an applicable annual catch limit (ACL) is anticipated to be exceeded. As a further restriction, to ensure this minor directed fishing provision is not exploited to make large aggregate harvests, minor directed fishing would not be allowed to exceed landings of 1 metric ton (mt) per day per vessel or person or one fishing trip per day by any vessel.", 2017-25200,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/11/22/2017-25200/fisheries-off-west-coast-states-coastal-pelagic-species-fisheries-amendment-16-to-the-coastal,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-11-22/pdf/2017-25200.pdf,11/22/2017

This draft guidance document is intended for any person who is responsible for a conclusion that a substance may be used in food on the basis of the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) when that person convenes a panel of experts (``GRAS panel'') to independently evaluate whether the available scientific data, information, and methods establish that the substance is safe under the conditions of its intended use in human food or animal food. This draft guidance provides our current thinking on best practices to identify GRAS panel members who have appropriate and balanced expertise; to take steps to reduce the risk that bias (or the appearance of bias) will affect the credibility of the GRAS panel's output (often called a ``GRAS panel report''), including the assessment of potential GRAS panel members for conflict of interest and the appearance of conflict of interest; and to limit the data and information provided to a GRAS panel to public information (e.g., by not providing the GRAS panel with information such as trade secret information).", 2017-24845,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/11/16/2017-24845/best-practices-for-convening-a-generally-recognized-as-safe-panel-draft-guidance-for-industry,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-11-16/pdf/2017-24845.pdf,11/16/2017

Group Registration of Newspapers,Proposed Rule,"Library of Congress; Copyright Office, Library of Congress","The U.S. Copyright Office is proposing to amend its regulation governing the group registration option for newspapers. The proposed rule will make a number of changes to reflect current Office practices, promote efficiency of the registration process, and encourage broader participation in the registration system by reducing the burden on applicants. Specifically, the proposed rule revises the definition of ``newspaper issues'' and clarifies that the group registration option is available to any qualifying ``newspaper issue.'' The proposed rule will require applicants to file an online application rather than a paper application, and upload a complete digital copy of each issue through the electronic registration system instead of submitting them in physical form. The Library of Congress intends to incorporate digital copies of newspapers received by the Office under this group registration option, and provide public access to them, subject to certain restrictions set forth in the proposed rule. Applicants may continue to submit their issues on microfilm (in addition to submitting digital files) on a voluntary basis if the microfilm is received by December 31, 2019. After that date, the microfilm option will be phased out. The proposed rule will clarify that each newspaper issue in the group must be a new collective work and a work made for hire, that the author and copyright claimant for each issue must be the same person or organization, and will clarify the scope of protection for newspaper issues, compared to individual components appearing within those issues. In addition, the proposed rule will require applicants to submit a full month of issues, and submit their claims within three months after the publication of the earliest issue in the group.

Amendment 16 would add a description to the CPS FMP of a very small sector of the CPS fishery that is not part of the primary commercial directed fishery and harvests minor amounts of CPS finfish. Total landings from this sector typically make up less than one percent of the total landings of any particular CPS stock. Currently, when directed fishing closures are enacted, these very small-scale fisheries have been precluded from fishing and/or harvesting these minor amounts because they do not fall under the existing exemptions during closures for incidental harvest or for harvesting CPS to be sold as live bait. The intent of Amendment 16 is to allow this sector to continue targeting CPS finfish after a directed fishery closure, while keeping the aggregate catch level within the applicable annual catch limit (ACL).", 2017-24097,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/11/06/2017-24097/fisheries-off-west-coast-states-coastal-pelagic-species-fisheries-amendment-16-to-the-coastal,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-11-06/pdf/2017-24097.pdf,11/06/2017

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants: Proposed Rulemaking To Designate Critical Habitat for the Main Hawaiian Islands Insular False Killer Whale Distinct Population Segment,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"We, NMFS, propose to designate critical habitat for the Main Hawaiian Islands insular false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) distinct population segment by designating waters from the 45-meter (m) depth contour to the 3200-m depth contour around the main Hawaiian Islands from Niihau east to Hawaii, pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Based on considerations of economic and national security impacts, we propose to exclude the following areas from designation because the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of inclusion and exclusion will not result in extinction of the species: The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's Call Area offshore of the Island of Oahu, the Pacific Missile Range Facilities Offshore ranges (including the Shallow Water Training Range, the Barking Sands Tactical Underwater Range, and the Barking Sands Underwater Range Extension), the Kingfisher Range, Warning Area 188, Kaula and Warning Area 187, Fleet Operational Readiness Accuracy Check Site Range, the Shipboard Electronic Systems Evaluation Facility, Warning Areas 196 and 191, and Warning Areas 193 and 194. In addition, the Ewa Training Minefield and the Naval Defensive Sea Area are precluded from designation under section 4(a)(3) of the ESA because they are managed under the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam Integrated Natural Resource Management Plan that we find provides a benefit to the Main Hawaiian Islands insular false killer whale. We are soliciting comments on all aspects of the proposal, including information on the economic, national security, and other relevant impacts.

The proposed rule is administrative in nature and is not anticipated to result in increased activity, effort, or capacity in the fishery.", 2017-23571,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/31/2017-23571/fisheries-off-west-coast-states-highly-migratory-fisheries-california-drift-gillnet-fishery,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-10-31/pdf/2017-23571.pdf,10/31/2017
Capital Planning and Supervisory Stress Testing,Proposed Rule,National Credit Union Administration,"The NCUA Board (``Board'') proposes to amend its regulations regarding capital planning and stress testing for federally insured credit unions with $10 billion or more in assets (covered credit unions). The proposal would reduce regulatory burden by removing some of the capital planning and stress testing requirements currently applicable to certain covered credit unions. The proposal would also make the NCUA's capital planning and stress testing requirements more efficient for covered credit unions and the NCUA by, among other things, authorizing credit unions to conduct their own stress tests in accordance with the NCUA's requirements and allowing those credit unions to incorporate the stress test results into their capital plan submissions.", 2017-23212,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/30/2017-23212/capital-planning-and-supervisory-stress-testing,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-10-30/pdf/2017-23212.pdf,10/30/2017
Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region; Temporary Measures To Reduce Overfishing of Golden Tilefish,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"This proposed temporary rule would implement interim measures to reduce overfishing of golden tilefish in Federal waters of the South Atlantic. Beginning in 2018, this temporary rule would reduce the total annual catch limit (ACL), the commercial and recreational sector ACLs, and the quotas for the hook-and-line and longline components of the commercial sector. This proposed temporary rule would be effective for 180 days, although NMFS may extend the temporary rule's effectiveness for a maximum of an additional 186 days. The intended effect of this proposed temporary rule is to reduce overfishing of golden tilefish while the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council develops long-term management measures.", 2017-23453,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/30/2017-23453/snapper-grouper-fishery-of-the-south-atlantic-region-temporary-measures-to-reduce-overfishing-of,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-10-30/pdf/2017-23453.pdf,10/30/2017
"Fisheries of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic; Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico; Modifications to the Number of Unrigged Hooks Carried On Board Bottom Longline Vessels",Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in an abbreviated framework action to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), as prepared by the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) Fishery Management Council (Council). This proposed rule would remove the limit on the number of unrigged hooks that a commercial reef fish vessel with a bottom longline endorsement is allowed on board when using or carrying bottom longline gear in the Federal waters of the eastern Gulf. The proposed rule would not change the limit of 750 hooks that these vessels can have rigged for fishing at any given time. The purpose of the proposed rule is to reduce the regulatory and potential economic burden to bottom longline fishers.", 2017-23460,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/30/2017-23460/fisheries-of-the-caribbean-gulf-of-mexico-and-south-atlantic-reef-fish-fishery-of-the-gulf-of-mexico,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-10-30/pdf/2017-23460.pdf,10/30/2017
Magnuson-Stevens Act Provisions; Fisheries Off West Coast States; Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery; Pacific Whiting; Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan; Amendment 21-3; Trawl Rationalization Program,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS proposes this interim measure to change the management of the Pacific whiting at-sea sectors' (i.e., the Mothership (MS) and Catcher/Processor (C/P) sectors) allocations for darkblotched rockfish and Pacific ocean perch (POP) by managing the allocations as set-asides rather than as total catch limits. This rule also proposes regulations in accordance with Amendment 21-3 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (PCGFMP) (see electronic access under SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION). The proposed action would revise regulations so that higher than anticipated harvest of darkblotched rockfish or POP that exceeds a sector's initial distribution of those species would not require automatic closure of one or more of the Pacific whiting at-sea sectors. This action is intended to reduce the risk of those sectors not attaining their respective Pacific whiting allocations based on the incidental catch of darkblotched rockfish or POP, when allowing the sector(s) to remain open would not exceed their respective annual catch limit (ACLs). This action would not change or increase the risk of exceeding darkblotched rockfish or POP ACL, as the proposed rule would also allow NMFS to close one or both of the MS and C/P sectors via automatic action if the species-specific set-aside amounts plus the available reserve for unforeseen catch events, known colloquially as the ``buffer,'' are anticipated to be exceeded.", 2017-23456,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/30/2017-23456/magnuson-stevens-act-provisions-fisheries-off-west-coast-states-pacific-coast-groundfish-fishery,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-10-30/pdf/2017-23456.pdf,10/30/2017

Annual Stress Test-Technical and Conforming Changes,Proposed Rule,Treasury Department; Comptroller of the Currency,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is inviting comment on a proposed rule that would make several revisions to its stress testing rule. The proposed rule would change the range of possible ``as-of'' dates used in the global market shock component to conform to changes recently made by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) to its stress testing regulations. The proposed rule would also change the transition process for covered institutions with $50 billion or more in assets. Under the proposed rule, a covered institution that becomes an over $50 billion covered institution, as that term is defined in the OCC stress testing regulation, before September 30 would become subject to the requirements applicable to an over $50 billion covered institution beginning on January 1 of the second calendar year after the covered institution becomes an over $50 billion covered institution, and a covered institution that becomes an over $50 billion covered institution after September 30 would become subject to the requirements applicable to an over $50 billion covered institution beginning on January 1 of the third calendar year after the covered institution becomes an over $50 billion covered institution. The proposed rule would also make certain technical changes to clarify the requirements of the OCC's stress testing regulation.", 2017-23353,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/27/2017-23353/annual-stress-test-technical-and-conforming-changes,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-10-27/pdf/2017-23353.pdf,10/27/2017

Hours of Service of Drivers: Application for Exemption; Western Equipment Dealers Association (WEDA),Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,"FMCSA announces that the Western Equipment Dealers Association (WEDA) has requested an exemption on behalf of several other organizations and their membership from the requirement that no later than December 18, 2017, a motor carrier require each of its drivers to use an electronic logging device (ELD) to record the driver's hours-of- service (HOS). WEDA states that equipment dealer operations in agriculture constitute unique circumstances that warrant the requested exemption, and not granting it will pose an undue burden on equipment dealers and their customers without any measurable safety benefit. In its application, WEDA seeks a five-year, renewable exemption from the ELD requirements which, the organization states, if granted will achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent the proposed exemption.

MPAA request this exemption to allow these drivers to complete paper records of duty status (RODS) instead of using an ELD device. MPAA believes that the exemption would not have any adverse impacts on operational safety because drivers would remain subject to the hours-of-service (HOS) regulations as well as the requirements to maintain paper RODS.

Atlantic Highly Migratory Species; Charter/Headboat Permit Commercial Sale Provision,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"This proposed rule would make HMS Charter/Headboat permits a non-commercial category and create a separate regulatory provision for the commercial sale of Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS) by HMS Charter/Headboat permit holders. Currently, all vessels issued an HMS Charter/Headboat permit could be categorized as a commercial fishing vessel and subject to United States Coast Guard (USCG) commercial fishing vessel safety requirements if they also possess a state commercial sale permit, regardless of whether the permit holder engages or intends to engage in commercial fishing. Under the proposed rule, HMS Charter/Headboat permit holders would be prohibited from selling Atlantic tunas or swordfish unless they obtain a ``commercial sale'' endorsement for their permit. This proposed rule would clarify which HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessels are properly categorized as commercial fishing vessels. This action would be administrative in nature and would not affect fishing practices or result in any significant environmental or economic impacts. This proposed rule has a 15-day comment period. The abbreviated comment period is necessary to implement any management changes before January 1, 2018 to ensure all HMS charter/headboat vessels are appropriately categorized as commercial or non-commercial upon initial application or renewal of 2018 HMS Charter/Headboat permits. We do not anticipate the proposal to be controversial or to generate significant public comment and believe that a 15-day comment period will be sufficient to attract any substantive public input.", 2017-23277,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/27/2017-23277/atlantic-highly-migratory-species-charterheadboat-permit-commercial-sale-provision,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-10-27/pdf/2017-23277.pdf,10/27/2017
Simplifications to the Capital Rule Pursuant to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996,Proposed Rule,Treasury Department; Comptroller of the Currency; Federal Reserve System; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,"In March 2017, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, the agencies) submitted a report to Congress pursuant to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996, in which they committed to meaningfully reduce regulatory burden, especially on community banking organizations. Consistent with that commitment, the agencies are inviting public comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking that would simplify compliance with certain aspects of the capital rule. A majority of the proposed simplifications would apply solely to banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule (non-advanced approaches banking organizations). Specifically, the agencies are proposing that non-advanced approaches banking organizations apply a simpler regulatory capital treatment for: Mortgage servicing assets; certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences; investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions; and capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties (minority interest). More generally, the proposal also includes revisions to the treatment of certain acquisition, development, or construction exposures that are designed to address comments regarding the current definition of high volatility commercial real estate exposure under the capital rule's standardized approach. Under the standardized approach, the proposed revisions to the treatment of acquisition, development, or construction exposures would not apply to existing exposures that are outstanding or committed prior to any final rule's effective date. In addition to the proposed simplifications, the agencies also are proposing various additional clarifications and technical amendments to the agencies' capital rule, which would apply to both non-advanced approaches banking organizations and advanced approaches banking organizations.", 2017-22093,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/27/2017-22093/simplifications-to-the-capital-rule-pursuant-to-the-economic-growth-and-regulatory-paperwork,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-10-27/pdf/2017-22093.pdf,10/27/2017

Atlantic Highly Migratory Species; Individual Bluefin Quota Program; Accountability for Bluefin Tuna Catch,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"NMFS proposes to modify the Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS) regulations to require vessels in the pelagic longline fishery to account for bycatch of bluefin tuna (bluefin) using Individual Bluefin Quota (IBQ) on a quarterly basis instead of before commencing any fishing trip with less than the minimum required IBQ balance or with quota debt. Specifically, vessels would be allowed to fish with an IBQ balance below the minimum amount currently required to depart on a fishing trip with pelagic longline gear, or with quota debt incurred by exceeding their IBQ balance, during a given calendar quarter; however, vessels would be required to reconcile quota debt and satisfy the minimum IBQ requirement prior to departing on a pelagic longline fishing trip in the subsequent calendar quarter. The action will further optimize fishing opportunity in the directed pelagic longline fishery for target species such as tuna and swordfish and improve the functionality of the IBQ Program and its accounting provisions, consistent with the objectives of Amendment 7 to the 2006 Consolidated HMS Fishery Management Plan (FMP).", 2017-23131,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/25/2017-23131/atlantic-highly-migratory-species-individual-bluefin-quota-program-accountability-for-bluefin-tuna,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-10-25/pdf/2017-23131.pdf,10/25/2017

Claims Procedure for Plans Providing Disability Benefits; Extension of Applicability Date,Proposed Rule,Labor Department; Employee Benefits Security Administration,"The Department of Labor proposes to delay for ninety (90) days--through April 1, 2018--the applicability of the Final Rule amending the claims procedure requirements applicable to ERISA-covered employee benefit plans that provide disability benefits.

The Final Rule currently is scheduled to apply to claims for disability benefits under ERISA-covered employee benefit plans that are filed on or after January 1, 2018.

The Department of Labor will carefully consider the submitted comments and data as part of its effort to examine regulatory alternatives that meet its objectives of ensuring the full and fair review of disability benefit claims while not imposing unnecessary costs and adverse consequences. The Department of Labor accordingly seeks public comment on a proposed 90-day delay of the applicability of the Final Rule in order to solicit additional public input and examine regulatory alternatives. If this proposal is finalized, the amendments made on December 19, 2016, would become applicable to claims for disability benefits that are filed after April 1, 2018, rather than January 1, 2018.", 2017-22082,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/12/2017-22082/claims-procedure-for-plans-providing-disability-benefits-extension-of-applicability-date,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-10-12/pdf/2017-22082.pdf,10/12/2017
Group Registration of Unpublished Works,Proposed Rule,"Library of Congress; Copyright Office, Library of Congress","The U.S. Copyright Office is proposing to create a new group registration option for a limited number of unpublished works. To qualify for this group option, all the works must be created by the same author or the same joint authors, and the author or joint authors must be named as the copyright claimant for each work. The claim to copyright in each work must be the same, and each work must be registered in the same administrative class. In general, applicants will be allowed to include up to five works in each submission. Applicants will be required to submit an online application and upload their works to the electronic registration system, although the Office may waive these requirements in exceptional cases. This new group registration option will replace the current ``unpublished collections'' option, which the Office has determined is an ineffective mechanism for registration of multiple unpublished works; among other things, it allows applicants to register an essentially unlimited number of works. The proposed rule will allow the Office to more easily examine each work for copyrightable authorship, create a more robust record of the claim, and improve the efficiency of the registration process. The Proposed Rule also makes unrelated technical amendments to the ``unit of publication'' regulation.", 2017-21722,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/12/2017-21722/group-registration-of-unpublished-works,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-10-12/pdf/2017-21722.pdf,10/12/2017
Approval and Promulgation of State Air Quality Plans for Designated Facilities and Pollutants; City of Philadelphia; Control of Emissions From Existing Hospital/Medical/Infectious Waste Incinerator Units,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"EPA is proposing to notify the public that it has received a negative declaration for the City of Philadelphia Air Management Services (Philadelphia AMS) for hospital/medical/infectious waste incinerator (HMIWI) units. This negative declaration certifies that HMIWI units subject to the requirements of sections 111(d) and 129 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) do not exist within the City of Philadelphia in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. EPA is accepting the negative declaration in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. In the Final Rules section of this Federal Register, EPA is accepting the negative declaration as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial submittal and anticipates no adverse comments. If no adverse comments are received in response to this action, no further activity is contemplated. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period.

Criteria and Process for the Cancellation of Standard Instrument Approach Procedures as Part of the National Procedures Assessment (NPA),Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"As new technology facilitates the introduction of area navigation (RNAV) instrument approach procedures over the past decade, the number of procedures available in the National Airspace System has nearly doubled. The complexity and cost to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of maintaining the instrument flight procedures inventory while expanding the new RNAV capability is not sustainable. The FAA is considering the cancellation of certain circling procedures (to include circling-only instrument approach procedures (IAPs) and circling minima charted on straight-in IAPs).

Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR): Request for Public Comments Regarding Standard and Routed Export Transactions,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; Census Bureau,"The Bureau of the Census (U.S. Census Bureau) is seeking public comments to perform a review of the requirements governing routed export transactions. In particular, the Census Bureau is interested in comments regarding the definition of a routed export transaction as well as the responsibilities of parties in routed export transactions. Routed export transactions are transactions in which the Foreign Principal Party in Interest (FPPI) controls the movement of the goods out of the country. There are a variety of reasons why the FPPI assumes this responsibility such as the use of a preferred carrier and the desire to not disclose the ultimate consignee to the U.S. Principal Party in Interest (USPPI), although the ultimate consignee is properly identified to the U.S. Government. Because the FPPI controls the movement of the goods in a routed transaction and cannot file Electronic Export Information (EEI), the Census Bureau requires the FPPI to authorize a U.S. authorized agent or the USPPI to file the EEI on its behalf. This ensures that the Census Bureau collects the statistical information.", 2017-21569,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/06/2017-21569/foreign-trade-regulations-ftr-request-for-public-comments-regarding-standard-and-routed-export,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-10-06/pdf/2017-21569.pdf,10/06/2017

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Withdrawal of the Proposed Rule to List Kenk's Amphipod,Proposed Rule,Interior Department; Fish and Wildlife Service,"We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), withdraw the proposed rule to list the Kenk's amphipod (Stygobromus kenki), an invertebrate from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act (Act) as amended. This withdrawal is based on our conclusion that the threats to the species as identified in the proposed rule are not as significant as we previously determined and the proposed listing is not warranted. We base this conclusion on our analysis of new information concerning the results of new surveys, current and future threats, and conservation efforts. We find the best scientific and commercial data available indicate that the Kenk's amphipod does not meet the statutory definitions of an endangered or threatened species.

Ocean Disposal; Temporary Modification of an Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site in Massachusetts Bay,Proposed Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a temporary modification of the currently-designated Massachusetts Bay Dredged Material Disposal Site (MBDS) pursuant to the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, as amended (MPRSA). The purpose of this temporary site modification is to allow for the environmental restoration of a particular area adjacent to the currently-designated MBDS (Potential Restoration Area) by temporarily expanding the boundaries of the existing MBDS. The temporary expansion is a circular area that contains the Potential Restoration Area, which includes most of the historic Industrial Waste Site (IWS). Decades ago, the IWS was used for the disposal of barrels containing industrial, chemical and radioactive waste, as well as for the disposal of munitions, ordnance, construction equipment, and contaminated dredged material. The proposed modification of the disposal site boundary will enable the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to place suitable dredged material from Boston Harbor generated during the Deep Draft Navigation Project at the Potential Restoration Area in order to cover the barrels and other wastes disposed there in the past. The Deep Draft Navigation Project includes maintenance dredging in the inner harbor, which includes the expansion of a confined aquatic disposal (CAD) cell and will generate approximately 1 million cubic yards (cy) of dredged material, as well as improvement dredging of the main ship channel, which will generate approximately 11 million cy of dredged material. The existing MBDS will continue to be used for disposal of other dredging projects as usual. The expansion area would be permanently closed upon completion of the Boston Harbor maintenance and improvement projects, while the existing MBDS will remain open for the disposal of suitable dredged material. Like the MBDS, however, the expansion would be subject to ongoing monitoring and management to ensure continued protection of the marine environment.", 2017-20326,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/09/22/2017-20326/ocean-disposal-temporary-modification-of-an-ocean-dredged-material-disposal-site-in-massachusetts,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-09-22/pdf/2017-20326.pdf,09/22/2017
